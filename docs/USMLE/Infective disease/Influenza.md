- Replication cycle
	1. Influenza viruses bind to the respiratory tract epithelium.
	2. Viral hemagglutinin (H) binds sialic acid residues (neuraminic acid derivatives) on the host cell membrane → virus fusion with the membrane → entry into the cell
	3. The virus replicates in the nucleus of the cell.
	4. The new virus particles travel to the cell membrane → formation of a membrane bud around the virus particles (budding).
	5. Viral neuraminidase (N) cleaves the neuraminic acid → virions exit the cell.
	6. Host cell dies → cellular breakdown triggers a strong immune response
- Subtypes are differentiated by cell surface antigens hemagglutinin and neuraminidase (e.g., H1N1 is "swine flu") 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hemagglutinin (H): promotes viral entry by binding to sialic acid residues</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Neuraminidase (N): promotes the release of virion progeny from host cells by cleaving terminal sialic acid residues</span>
- Genetic mutations

		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Two subtypes of viruses</span> (e.g., human and swine influenza) infect the same cell and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">exchange genetic segments</span> (reassortment) to create new subtypes (e.g., H3N1 → H2N1).
		- Causes pandemics
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Antigenic drift</span>
		- Minor changes in antigenic structure (hemagglutinin and/or neuraminidase) <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">via random point mutation</span>
		- Causes epidemics (limited to a specific population or region)

# Complications
---
## Secondary bacterial bronchitis and [[../Respiratory/Pneumonia|pneumonia]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Etiology: Common causative pathogens include S. pneumoniae, S. aureus (including MRSA), S. pyogenes, and H. influenzae.</span>
- Pathophysiology
	- Influenza virus attacks the tracheobronchial epithelium and results in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decreased cell size and a loss of cilia, which promotes bacterial colonization.</span>
	- The influenza surface protein neuraminidase also cleaves sialic acid off host glycoproteins, leading to an <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased amount of free sugar in the respiratory tract, which fosters bacterial growth.</span>
- Clinical features
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Development of a purulent, productive cough ∼ 4–14 days after an initial period of improvement </span>
	- Recurrent fever
	- Symptoms similar to community-acquired [[../Respiratory/Pneumonia|pneumonia]]
