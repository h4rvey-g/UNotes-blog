# Oseltamivir, zanamivir
- Inhibit [[./Influenza|influenza]] neuraminidase → ↓ release of progeny virus.
	- A viral enzyme that cleaves neuraminic acid residues from glycoprotein, which results in viral release from the host cell. Found in [[./Influenza|influenza]] virus.

# Acyclovir, famciclovir, valacyclovir
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Guanosine analogs</span>. 
- HSV/VZV-coded thymidine kinase monophosphorylates the guanosine analogue to an active intermediate → phosphorylation by cellular kinases → acyclovir triphosphate (ACV-TP)![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240207162621.png|Pasted image 20240207162621.png]]
