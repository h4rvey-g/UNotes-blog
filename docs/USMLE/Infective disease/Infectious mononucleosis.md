# Epidemiology
---
- General: Approx. 90–95% of adults are EBV-seropositive worldwide.
- Peak incidence (of symptomatic disease): <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">15–24 years of age</span>

# Etiology
---
- Pathogen: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), also called human herpesvirus 4 (HHV-4)
- Transmission: Infectious mononucleosis spreads via bodily secretions, especially saliva. Therefore, it is also called kissing disease.

# Pathophysiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">EBV infects B lymphocytes in mucosal epithelium (e.g., oropharynx, cervix) via the CD21 receptor</span> → infected B lymphocytes induce a humoral (B-cell) as well as a cellular (T-cell) immune response  → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">an increased concentration of atypical lymphocytes in the bloodstream, which are CD8+ cytotoxic T cells that fight infected B lymphocytes</span> 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Atypical lymphocytes are not infected by virus; they react to infected cells. They contain cytotoxic granules composed of perforin (creates holes in the infected cell's membrane) and granzymes (enter the cytoplasm of infected cells and trigger cell death)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The name "mononucleosis" is derived from the monocyte-like appearance of (atypical) lymphocytes under the microscope.</span>
	- The T-cell response is crucial for overcoming the infection. However, if the response is not sufficient (e.g., in [[./Human immunodeficiency virus|HIV]] patients), B cells may proliferate uncontrollably and increase the risk of complications. For example, the high rate of proliferation increases the risk of oncogenic mutations that lead to the development of B-cell lymphomas.

# Clinical features
---
- Incubation period: ∼ 6 weeks
- Clinical course
	- Symptoms typically occur in adolescents and young adults and last for 2–4 weeks.
- Signs and symptoms
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Blood/Splenomegaly|Splenomegaly]]</span>, fever, fatigue, malaise 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pharyngitis and/or tonsillitis</span> (reddened, enlarged tonsils covered in pus), palatal petechiae 
	- Bilateral <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">cervical lymphadenopathy</span> (especially posterior) that may become generalized and can, in severe cases, lead to airway obstruction
	- Abdominal pain
	- Possibly <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../GI/Hepatomegaly|hepatomegaly]]</span> and jaundice 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Maculopapular rash (similar to measles): The rash is caused by the infection itself in about 5% of cases but is most commonly associated with the empiric administration of aminopenicillin (e.g., ampicillin, amoxicillin)</span>

>[!warning] 
>[[../Blood/Splenomegaly|Splenomegaly]] can lead to a potentially life-threatening splenic rupture!
# Diagnostics
---
- Monospot test
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Detects heterophile antibodies produced in response to EBV infection using RBCs from sheep or horses</span>
	- Patient's serum is mixed with a solution of sheep/horse RBC in vitro
		- Positive test: cross-reaction between heterophile antibodies and sheep/horse RBCs → agglutination
		- Negative test
			- No heterophile antibodies present → no cross-reaction → no agglutination
			- In some cases, the test can show negative results if it is performed too soon (i.e. within the first 1–2 weeks after symptom onset) and antibodies have not developed yet.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Specificity of ∼ 100%, sensitivity of 85%</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Peripheral smear: lymphocytosis with > 10% atypical lymphocytes (in some cases, up to 90%) </span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240321211059.png|Pasted image 20240321211059.png]]
