## Side effects of antituberculosis agents
- Isoniazid
	- Asymptomatic elevation of transaminases 
	- [[../Pharmacology/Cytochrome P450|Cytochrome P450]] inhibition: leading to interactions with numerous drugs, including antiretroviral agents, cardiovascular agents, and antibiotics
	- Less common
		- Drug-induced lupus
		- [[../Biochemistry/Vitamin B6|Vitamin B6]] deficiency: [[../Blood/Sideroblastic anemia|sideroblastic anemia]], peripheral neuropathy 
		- CNS toxicity: precipitation of benzodiazepine-refractory seizures with high doses of isoniazid, psychosis, ataxia 
		- Others: anion gap metabolic acidosis, pellagra, optic neuritis
- Rifampin
	- [[../Pharmacology/Cytochrome P450|Cytochrome P450]] induction: leading to important interactions with ART in patients with [[./Human immunodeficiency virus|HIV]] (therefore, rifabutin is preferred) 
	- Orange discoloration of body fluids
- Pyrazinamide	
	- Greatest hepatotoxicity potential
	- [[../MSK/Gout|Hyperuricemia]]
- Ethambutol	
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Optic neuritis (reversible red-green color blindness)</span>
