- Should be initiated before traveling to regions with a high risk of malaria, e.g., tropical Africa, Asia, and Central/South America
- Drug of choice is based on the region traveled and Plasmodium species
	- Areas with P. falciparum
		- If chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum (most malaria endemic regions): atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, mefloquine
		- If chloroquine-sensitive P. falciparum: chloroquine
	- Areas without P. falciparum (some areas of Central/South America, Mexico, China, South Korea): primaquine
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Agents that are safe during pregnancy: chloroquine, mefloquine</span>

>Prophylactic medication <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">cannot prevent infection but instead suppresses the course of the disease and its symptoms</span> by killing the parasite within the host before it can cause severe disease. There is no prophylactic medication that provides protection against all species of the Plasmodium genus.
