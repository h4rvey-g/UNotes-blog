# Pathophysiology


---
# Clinical features
1. Local reaction (swimmer's itch or cercarial dermatitis): pruritic maculopapular rash at the point of entry of cercaria into human skin 
2. Acute schistosomiasis syndrome (Katayama fever)
	- [[../Immunology/Serum sickness|Serum sickness]]-like disease: immune complex formation of antigens released from eggs and/or adult worms with host antibodies
	- Incubation period: 3â€“8 weeks
	- Clinical features: fever, fatigue, cough
3. Chronic schistosomiasis: Deposition of eggs leads to chronic inflammation and granuloma formation.
## Subtypes
- Genitourinary schistosomiasis
	- S. haematobium
	- Hematuria, dysuria
	- Complications (especially with chronic infection)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder</span> (may cause painless hematuria)
			- Rare tumor (approximately only 2% of bladder malignancies are squamous cell carcinomas)
- Hepatosplenic schistosomiasis
	- Children and adolescents: hepatosplenomegaly
	- Adults with chronic infection: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">periportal fibrosis and portal hypertension</span>
- Pulmonary schistosomiasis
	- All three pathogens
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale</span>
