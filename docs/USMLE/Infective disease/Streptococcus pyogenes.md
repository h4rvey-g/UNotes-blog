# Virulence factors and resistances
- Toxins
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Erythrogenic exotoxin A</span>
	- Streptolysin O
	- Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins
		- Bridges MHC class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells and T-cell receptors on T cells outside of the normal binding sites
		- Results in a large release of IL-1, IL-2, IFN-γ, and TNF-α
- Enzymes
	- DNase: destroys neutrophils → potentiates infection and transmission
	- Streptokinase
	- Hyaluronidase
- Proteins
	- Protein F: fibronectin‑binding protein that mediates adherence to epithelial cells
	- M protein (virulence factor): prevents opsonization by C3b
- Hyaluronic acid capsule: inhibits phagocytosis
# Associated conditions
- Head and neck
	- Pharyngitis
	- Tonsillitis
	- Peritonsillar abscess
	- Otitis media
- Skin and soft tissues (pyogenic)
	- Erysipelas
	- Cellulitis
	- Impetigo (“honey-crusted” lesions)
	- Necrotizing fasciitis
	- Perianal streptococcal dermatitis
