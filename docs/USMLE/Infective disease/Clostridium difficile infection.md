## Risk factors for CDI
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Recent antibiotic treatment</span>
	- Antibiotics destroy the normal intestinal bacterial flora that normally suppresses C. difficile overgrowth. C. difficile is resistant to most of the commonly used antibiotics.
	- High-risk antibiotics (odds ratio ≥ 5)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Clindamycin</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cephalosporins</span>
		- Fluoroquinolones
- Advanced age
- Gastric acid suppression (e.g., with proton pump inhibitors) or bypass (e.g., enteral feeding)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Recent hospitalization</span>

# Pathophysiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Toxin A (enterotoxin): binding to brush border of enterocytes → disruption of actin cytoskeleton functioning → increase in epithelial permeability and apoptosis → diarrhea</span>
- Toxin B (cytotoxin): same as in toxin A, but can also cause pore formation within the endosomal membrane via insertion of the translocation domain → release of endosomal content into the cytosol → cytopathic effect
