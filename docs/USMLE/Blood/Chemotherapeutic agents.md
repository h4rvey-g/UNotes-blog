>[!Mnemonic] 
>- Mnemo I use for Doxorubicin /Daunorubicin:
> 	- They both end in -rubicin -> ruby (= red) -> the heart is red -> cardiotoxicity
> 	- Dilated cardiomyopathy because it starts with D like Doxorubicin
> 	- Dexrazoxane used to prevent it -> also starts with D and sounds like Roxane ('Roxane, you don't have to put on the red light', song by the police) -> again red for RUBYcin and heart.

# Anticancer treatment-related complications
## Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Acute-phase CINV</span> (<24 hours after chemotherapy) is mediated primarily by the release of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">serotonin</span> from intestinal enterochromaffin cells that have been damaged by chemotherapy.  Serotonin stimulates vagal afferent fibers (5-HT3 receptors) in the bowel wall, which project to the brainstem and stimulate the vomiting reflex.  Therefore, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">serotonin receptor antagonists (eg, ondansetron)</span> can be used for treatment.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Delayed-phase CINV</span> (1-5 days after chemotherapy) is mediated primarily by increased levels of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">substance P</span> in the brainstem due to chemotherapy-associated emetic stimuli in the cerebrospinal fluid and bloodstream.  Substance P binds to and activates the neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor in areas of the brainstem that mediate vomiting (eg, nucleus tractus solitarius, area postrema).  Therefore, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">NK1 receptor antagonists (eg, aprepitant, fosaprepitant)</span> are often used for treatment.
