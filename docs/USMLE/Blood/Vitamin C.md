# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
severe malnutrition (e.g., due to alcoholism, illicit drug use, and/or psychiatric illness)

---
# Pathophysiology
## Vitamin C functions
- Hydrophilic antioxidant
- Conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine: coenzyme in dopamine β-hydroxylase
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Biochemistry/Collagen|Collagen]] synthesis: coenzyme in hydroxylation reaction of proline and lysine</span>
- Facilitates iron [[../GI/Absorption|absorption]] (keeps iron in Fe2+ reduced state)

# Clinical features
- Scurvy: clinical manifestation of vitamin C deficiency, which leads to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">impaired [[../Biochemistry/Collagen|collagen]] synthesis and easily damaged connective tissue</span>
	- Follicular hyperkeratosis, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">perifollicular hemorrhage</span>, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">coiled “corkscrew” hair</span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240203104415.png|Pasted image 20240203104415.png]]![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240203104700.png|Pasted image 20240203104700.png]]
	- Subperiosteal hemorrhage
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Gingivitis</span>, swollen gums
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Mucosal bleeding, easy bruising, petechiae</span>
	- Impaired wound healing
	- Arthralgia, hemarthrosis
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Signs of anemia (fatigue, paleness)</span>
		- Normocytic anemia: decreased iron absorption in the small intestine
		- Macrocytic anemia: decreased conversion of folate into its active metabolite
- Poor immune response
>[!tip] 
>Suspect scurvy when the patient is malnourished, with symptoms of corkscrew hair, bleeding, anemia.
