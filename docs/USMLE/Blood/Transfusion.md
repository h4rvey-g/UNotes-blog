Why <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">platelets</span> must be stored in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">room temperature</span>?
1. Cold storage can activate platelets: Cold storage of platelets at temperatures below room temperature (15 °C) can induce platelet activation, resulting in changes in platelet shape and functionality. This activation can lead to platelet aggregation and a decrease in platelet viability, making the stored platelets less effective for transfusion purposes.
2. Platelet clearance from circulation: Platelets stored at refrigerating temperatures are rapidly cleared from the bloodstream when transfused, reducing their effectiveness. Cold storage can cause clustering of glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) receptors on the platelet surface, which exposes beta-N-acetylglucosamine residues. These exposed residues are recognized by liver macrophages, leading to rapid clearance of the platelets through phagocytosis. This clearance mechanism limits the viability and availability of cold-stored platelets

## Fresh frozen plasma
- Content
	- Plasma, including all coagulation factors and plasma proteins
	- All cellular components are removed from the transfusion product.
- Indications 
	- Management of coagulopathy in patients with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">multiple clotting factor deficiencies (e.g., due to liver cirrhosis, DIC)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Immediate reversal of warfarin</span>
		- Ineffective in heparin overdose (contains antithrombin III → enhances heparin effect)
## Cryoprecipitate
- Content: clotting factors (fibrinogen, factor VIII, factor XIII), vWF, and fibronectin
	- Cryoprecipitate is obtained by centrifuging thawed FFP at cool temperatures, thus containing higher concentration of fibrinogen.
- Indications
	- Bleeding associated with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">fibrinogen deficiency</span> (e.g., due to DIC, liver disease)
