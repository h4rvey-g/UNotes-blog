			- Normally, activated protein C (APC) inactivates factor V in the clotting cascade → decreases the activation of thrombin.
			- A DNA point mutation substitutes guanine for adenine → corresponding mRNA codon forms glutamine in place of arginine on position 506 (Arg506Gln mutation) near the polypeptide cleavage site of factor V
			- In such patients, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Gln506-Va is resistant to cleavage by APC → factor V remains active → activates prothrombin → increases thrombotic events (e.g., peripheral and cerebral vein thrombosis, recurrent pregnancy loss)</span>
			- Risk of thromboembolism is several times higher in patients with homozygous mutations than in those with heterozygous mutations.
		- Protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency
- Antithrombin
	- Degrades thrombin and factors IXa and Xa
	- Activates tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)
