An acquired genetic defect of the hematopoietic stem cell characterized by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">a triad of hemolytic [[./Anemia|anemia]], pancytopenia, and thrombosis</span>
# Epidemiology

# Etiology

# Pathophysiology
- Physiologically, a membrane-bound glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor protects RBCs against [[../Immunology/Complement system|complement]]-mediated hemolysis.
- Acquired mutation on the PIGA gene located on the X chromosome → GPI anchor loses its protective effect → RBC destruction by [[../Immunology/Complement system|complement]] and reticuloendothelial system → intravascular and [[./Lab findings of hemolysis|extravascular hemolysis]]![[../../assets/img/0c4abbceeb2a64bddf60c772faad8b4.jpg|0c4abbceeb2a64bddf60c772faad8b4.jpg]]
- PNH can also occur in patients with aplastic [[./Anemia|anemia]] and [[./Myelodysplastic syndromes|MDS]].

# Clinical features
- Pallor, excessive fatigue, weakness
- Intermittent jaundice
- Episodes of hemoglobinuria causing pink/red/[[../Renal/Urine color|dark urine]] which usually occurs in the morning due to the concentration of urine overnight.
- Vasoconstriction
	- The scavenging of nitric oxide by free Hb results in smooth muscle contraction.
	- Headache, [[../Respiratory/Pulmonary hypertension|pulmonary hypertension]]
	- Abdominal pain, dysphagia, erectile dysfunction
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Venous thrombosis in unusual locations (e.g., hepatic, cerebral, and/or abdominal veins)</span>
	- Hemolysis generates free Hb, which scavenges serum nitric oxide (a vasodilator), causing vasoconstriction.
	- Free Hb also promotes oxidative stress, which activates the endothelium of blood vessels, inducing platelet aggregation.
- Increased risk of infections (in case of pancytopenia)

# Diagnostics
- CBC: anemia, thrombocytopenia, and/or pancytopenia ; usually ↑ reticulocytes
- Hemolysis workup: ↓ haptoglobin
- Direct Coombs test: negative  
	- [[../Immunology/Complement system|complement]]-mediated RBC destruction
- Flow cytometry of peripheral blood (confirmatory test for PNH): can show deficiency of GPI-linked proteins on the surface of RBCs and WBCs (e.g., CD55, CD59)
