# Clinical features
- Anemia and pallor
- Jaundice (due to ↑ unconjugated bilirubin)
- [[./Splenomegaly|Splenomegaly]] with left upper quadrant pain
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Black pigment [[../GI/Gallstones|gallstones]] (made of calcium bilirubinate)</span>, may lead to cholecystitis

# Diagnostics
- Normocytic anemia: mean cell volume (MCV) within normal range (80-100 fL) or slightly decreased
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC)</span>
	- The increase in MCHC is the result of a decrease in RBC cell volume (caused by a decrease in RBC water content), whereas the hemoglobin content remains constant.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Red blood cell distribution width (↑ RDW)</span>
	- This finding is highly suggestive of HS!
- ↑ Reticulocytes (normal range: 0.5%–1.5% of total RBC count)
- Findings of hemolytic anemia
	- ↑ Unconjugated bilirubin
	- ↓ Haptoglobin
	- ↑ LDH
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Eosin-5-maleimide binding test (EMA binding test)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Test of choice, as results are readily available (within two hours)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Decreased binding between dye (eosin-5-maleimide) and RBC membrane proteins</span>
	- Binding is quantified using flow cytometry, which shows decreased mean fluorescence
- Positive osmotic fragility test
