# Physiologic anticoagulants
- Inhibit intrinsic pathway: 
	- Antithrombin (with heparin): inhibit factor 2(thrombin), 9, 10, 11, 12
	- [[./Inhibition of hemostasis|Protein C]]: inhibit 5, 8; need VitK to synthesize
- Inhibit extrinsic pathway:
	- TFPI(Tissue factor pathway inhibitor): combine factor 10 to inhibit factor 8
# Oral anticoagulants

>- Heparin: also affects VIII and IX -> intrinsic pathway -> PTT
>- Warfarin: affects both intrinsic and extrinsic pathway, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">but VII has shorter half life -> extrinsic pathway -> PT</span>
>	- The half-lives of the procoagulants are ∼ 2–4 days (except for factor VII, which has a short half-life), while the anticoagulants only have half-lives of 6–10 hours.
>	- Intrinsic pathway remains active another 2–3 days, while extrinsic pathway and [[./Inhibition of hemostasis|protein C]] are already inactive.

- Direct thrombin inhibitors: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">prolonged thrombin time (TT), no change to PTT or PT (not routinely monitored)</span>
- Direct factor Xa inhibitors: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">prolonged PT and PTT, unchanged thrombin time (not routinely monitored)

## Adverse effects
### Warfarin
- Warfarin-induced skin necrosis
	- Seen within the first few days of treatment with high doses of warfarin
	- Warfarin inhibits all [[../Biochemistry/Vitamin K|vitamin K]]-dependent coagulation factors:  anticoagulants<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> [[./Inhibition of hemostasis|protein C]] and protein S have a relatively short half-life and are depleted more quickly</span> than procoagulants factors II, IX, and X  → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased factor V and VIII activity (which [[./Inhibition of hemostasis|protein C]] and S normally inactivate)  → initial hypercoagulable state  → formation of microthrombi → vascular occlusion, tissue infarction, and blood extravasation</span>
	- Increased risk in patients with underlying hereditary [[./Inhibition of hemostasis|protein C]] deficiency
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Presentation: painful purpura, hemorrhagic blisters, and large areas of necrosis; mostly affects subcutaneous adipose tissue </span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240306171857.png|Pasted image 20240306171857.png]]
	- Immediate management: discontinue warfarin, administer IV [[../Biochemistry/Vitamin K|vitamin K]], unfractionated heparin, and source of [[./Inhibition of hemostasis|protein C]] ([[./Inhibition of hemostasis|protein C]] concentrate, FFP); surgical debridement and grafting in therapy-refractory cases
	- Prevention: temporary <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">bridging anticoagulation</span> with heparin until warfarin has started to act and the initial hypercoagulable state has been bridged

>Anticoagulants cause thrombosis, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">this can also be seen in [[./Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia|HIT]].</span>
## Warfarin reversal
### Active hemorrhage (regardless of INR)
- Stop warfarin.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Administer IV [[../Biochemistry/Vitamin K|vitamin K]] PLUS 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC)</span>
	- If PCC is unavailable, give fresh frozen plasma (FFP)
- Monitor INR every 6 hours until warfarin has been fully reversed (INR ≤ 1.1)
## Bridging anticoagulation
- Bridging anticoagulation: the administration of heparin for the duration of the transient hypercoagulable state caused by warfarin therapy. Heparin prevents coagulation by activating antithrombin.
	- Reduces risk of venous thromboembolism and skin necrosis
	- May also be used during interruptions of warfarin therapy (e.g., surgery)
- Periprocedural bridging anticoagulation
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Because the effect of coumarin can last several days, it is necessary to switch to heparins before surgery (preferably LMWH) to reduce the risk of intraoperative bleeding.</span>
	1. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Interrupt VKAs as needed (e.g., patients with high periprocedural bleeding risk) a few days before the procedure.</span>
	2. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Initiate bridging anticoagulation once the INR is in the subtherapeutic range,</span>
	3. Administer the last dose of LMWH 24 hours before the procedure (4–6 hours before the procedure for UFH).
	4. Resume VKA after surgery ; consider postprocedural bridging anticoagulation as needed (e.g., patients with high periprocedural thrombotic risk.
