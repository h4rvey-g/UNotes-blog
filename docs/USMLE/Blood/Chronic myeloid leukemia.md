## Philadelphia chromosome
- Reciprocal translocation between chromosome 9 and chromosome 22 → formation of the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Philadelphia chromosome t(9;22)</span> → fusion of the ABL1 gene (chromosome 9) with the BCR gene (chromosome 22) → formation of the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">BCR-ABL gene</span> → encodes a BCR-ABL non-receptor <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">tyrosine kinase</span> with increased enzyme activity
- Result: inhibits physiologic apoptosis and increases mitotic rate → uncontrolled proliferation of functional granulocytes

## Targeted therapy: tyrosine kinase inhibitors
TKIs are the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">primary drug class</span> used to treat CML.
- Agents
	- First-generation TKIs (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">imatinib</span>): indicated in low-risk CP-CML, patients with comorbidities, or older patients 
	- Second-generation TKIs (e.g., dasatinib, nilotinib): usually indicated in AP-CML
- Mechanism of action
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Selective inhibition of tyrosine kinase</span> (e.g., by blocking its ATP binding site): inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream signaling proteins (no phosphate transfer from ATP to tyrosine residues)
	- Disruption of the BCR-ABL1 pathway: inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in BCR-ABL1-positive cells
