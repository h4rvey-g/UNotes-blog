# Pathophysiology
- Point mutation in the β-globin gene (chromosome 11) → glutamic acid replaced with valine (single amino acid substitution) → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">2 α-globin and 2 mutated β-globin subunits create pathological [[./Hemoglobin variants|hemoglobin]] S (HbS)</span>.
	- Heterozygotes (HbAS): carry one sickle allele and one other (usually normal) → sickle cell trait
	- Homozygotes (HbSS): carry two sickle alleles → sickle cell anemia
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">HbS polymerizes when deoxygenated, causing deformation of erythrocytes (“sickling”).</span> This can be triggered by any event associated with reduced oxygen tension.
	- Hypoxia (e.g., at high altitudes)
		- In homozygotes, up to 100% of the [[./Hemoglobin variants|hemoglobin]] molecules are affected, leading to sickle cell formation under minimally decreased oxygen tension.
		- In heterozygotes, sickling only occurs due to severe reduction in oxygen tension.
	- Infections
	- Dehydration
	- Acidosis
	- Sudden changes in temperature
	- Stress
- Sickle cells lack elasticity and adhere to vascular endothelium, which disrupts microcirculation and causes <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">vascular occlusion and subsequent tissue infarction</span>.
- Hemolysis and the subsequent <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased turnover of erythrocytes may increase the demand for folate, causing folate deficiency.</span>
	- Can present as <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">macrocytic anemia</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[./Lab findings of hemolysis|Extravascular hemolysis]] and [[./Lab findings of hemolysis|intravascular hemolysis]] are common and result in anemia.</span>

# Diagnostics
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Normal RBC indices (e.g. MCV)</span>
	- Not all red blood cells are sickled

# Treatment
## Overview
### Infants and children
- Antibiotic prophylaxis against invasive pneumococcal disease until 5 years of age
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hydroxyurea therapy</span> regardless of clinical severity to minimize disease-related complications **(First-line)**
- Annual transcranial doppler to screen for stroke risk from 2 months till 16 years of age
### Hydroxyurea therapy
#### Indications
- All infants > 9 months, children, and adolescents with sickle cell anemia regardless of symptom severity 
- Adults with any of the following:
	- Frequent (≥ 3 episodes/year) acute pain episodes or other vasoocclusive events
	- Severe symptomatic anemia
	- History of severe and/or recurrent acute chest syndrome
#### Mechanism of action
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Stimulation of erythropoiesis and increased fetal [[./Hemoglobin variants|hemoglobin]]</span>

# Complications
## Splenic sequestration
- Pathophysiology: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">splenic vasoocclusion and entrapment and pooling of large amounts of blood in the spleen</span>
- Clinical presentation
	- Most commonly affects children < 5 years of age
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Acute left upper quadrant pain, [[./Splenomegaly|splenomegaly]]</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypotension and/or hypovolemic shock</span>, especially in infants
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Due to the trapping of blood in the spleen</span>
	- Symptoms of anemia (e.g., pallor, fatigue)
- Supportive findings 
	- Anemia (Hb drop of ≥ 2 g/dL) with reticulocytosis
	- Thrombocytopenia
- Acute management
	- Immediate IV fluid resuscitation for hypovolemia
	- Simple RBC [[./Transfusion|transfusion]] in consultation with a sickle cell expert (avoid raising hemoglobin > 8 g/dL)
