# Epidemiology

# Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Autosomal dominant</span> gene mutation, with variable penetrance
- Trigger → ↑ heme demand and biosynthesis → impaired enzyme activity due to a mutation of porphobilinogen deaminase (PBG-D) (previously known as uroporphyrinogen I synthase)  →<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> accumulation of heme intermediates porphobilinogen (PBG) and δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)</span> → symptoms
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">ALA and it's derivates are neurotoxic</span>
## Triggers
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most triggers increase the demand for hepatic heme</span>, thereby stimulating heme biosynthesis, which, in the setting of an AIP enzyme mutation, results in the accumulation of heme intermediates.
- Medications (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">especially inducers of hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes</span>, which are used in the biosynthesis of heme), including:
	- [[../Neurology/Anticonvulsant drugs|Anticonvulsants]] (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin)
	- Sulfonamides
	- [[../Neurology/Inhalational anesthetics|Anesthetics]]
	- Hormone therapy
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Alcohol</span>
- Smoking
- [[../Biochemistry/Metabolic fuel use|Fasting]]

# Clinical features
The clinical presentation of AIP is variable and symptoms are often nonspecific. In contrast to some porphyrias, there are no dermatological findings.
- Acute attacks
	- GI symptoms: severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Neurogenic, not infectious or inflammatory.</span>
	- Neurological abnormalities: polyneuropathies (nonspecific pain, weakness/fatigue, paresthesia, paresis), seizures, respiratory paralysis
	- Autonomic dysfunction: tachycardia, hypertension 
	- Psychiatric abnormalities: hallucinations, disorientation, anxiety, insomnia 
	- Red-purple urine
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Due to the accumulation of porphyrins and/or bilirubin in urine.</span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240120164805.png|Pasted image 20240120164805.png]]
		- Porphyria is from the Greek “porphyros,” meaning purple. Urine may also show discoloration after prolonged exposure to sunlight.

# Treatment
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hemin therapy</span>
	- Start as soon as possible
	- Mechanism: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hemin is an iron-containing porphyrin that decreases the activity of δ-aminolevulinate synthase, thereby decreasing heme biosynthesis and the accumulation of intermediates.</span>
- Glucose loading: consider only for mild attacks or as temporizing measure
