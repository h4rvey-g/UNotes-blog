# Epidemiology

# Etiology
- Strong association with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) </span>
- Immunodeficiency: e.g., organ or cell transplantation, immunosuppressants, HIV infection , chemotherapy
- Autoimmune diseases (e.g., [[../MSK/Rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis]], [[../Respiratory/Sarcoidosis|sarcoidosis]])

# Pathophysiology

# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">B symptoms</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Night sweats, weight loss > 10% in the past 6 months, fever > 38°C (100.4°F)</span>
- Pel-Ebstein fever: Intermittent fever with periods of high temperature for 1–2 weeks, followed by afebrile periods for 1–2 weeks. Relatively rare but very specific for HL.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Alcohol-induced pain</span>: Pain in involved lymph nodes after ingestion of alcohol. Relatively rare but highly specific for HL.

# Diagnostics
## Histology
- Lymph node excision 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Reed-Sternberg cells (RSCs)</span>
		- Tumor cells that are pathognomonic of HL
		- Originate from B cells
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Large cells with binuclear/bilobed nuclei with dark centers of chromatin and pale halos, which results in an owl-eye appearance on histopathologic examination.</span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231107171030.png|Pasted image 20231107171030.png]]
		- CD15/CD30-positive
	- Hodgkin cells: mononuclear, malignant B lymphocytes 
		- Polynuclear RSCs are giant cells formed through the fusion of multiple Hodgkin cells.
