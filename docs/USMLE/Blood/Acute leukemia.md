# Epidemiology
- Acute lymphoblastic leukemia
	- Peak incidence: 2–5 years
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most common malignant disease in children</span>
	- ∼ 80% of acute leukemias during childhood are lymphoblastic.

---
# Etiology
## Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
- Genetic or chromosomal factors
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Biochemistry/Down syndrome|Down syndrome]]: Risk of ALL is, like that of AML, 10–20 times higher in patients with [[../Biochemistry/Down syndrome|Down syndrome]] compared to the general population.</span>
	- [[../Neurology/Neurocutaneous disorders|Neurofibromatosis]] type 1
	- Ataxia telangiectasia

# Pathophysiology


---
# Clinical features
- Oncologic emergencies can be the first sign of leukemia, e.g., an elderly patient presenting with priapism or DIC may have leukostasis (more common in AML than ALL)
>[!warning] 
>The identification of DIC suggests APL, which is a medical emergency. Consult hematology and/or oncology immediately and transfer the patient to a critical care unit.

# Diagnostics
>[!tip] 
>Some subtypes (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">especially M3, or APL</span>) exhibit Auer rods 
>- Pink-red, rod-shaped granular cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in malignant immature myeloblasts or promyelocytes![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240209151353.png|Pasted image 20240209151353.png]]
>- Myeloperoxidase (MPO) positive
## Genetic studies
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">APL: t(15;17) translocation, producing PML-RARA</span>

# Treatment
>[!tip] 
>In <font color="#ffc000">APL, the t(15;17) translocation</font> and subsequent formation of the PML-RARA fusion gene can inhibit myeloblast differentiation under physiological levels of retinoic acid. <font color="#ffc000">High doses of ATRA (a [[../Biochemistry/Vitamin A|vitamin A]] derivative) may induce myeloblast differentiation and promote remission.</font>
