# Etiology
- The JAK2 (Janus kinase 2) oncogene codes for a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">non-receptor tyrosine kinase</span> in hematopoietic progenitor cells. JAK2 is essential for the regulation of erythropoiesis, thrombopoiesis (megakaryopoiesis), and granulopoiesis. 
- 98% of patients with polcythemia vera have a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">mutation in the JAK2 gene (gain of function) </span>→ <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ tyrosine kinase activity → erythropoietin-independent proliferation of the myeloid cell lines → ↑ blood cell mass (erythrocytosis, thrombocytosis, and granulocytosis) → hyperviscosity and slow blood flow → ↑ risk of thrombosis and poor oxygenation.</span>

# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pruritus: Itching typically worsens when the skin comes into contact with warm water (aquagenic pruritus).</span>
- Complications
	- Venous thrombosis
	- Arterial thrombosis
	- Hemorrhagic complications

# Diagnostics
>[!tip] 
>Erythrocytosis associated with normal oxygen saturation and decreased serum EPO levels is strongly suggestive of polycythemia vera.
