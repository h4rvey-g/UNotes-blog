# Sources of exposure
- Fires: Cyanide is released by various substances during combustion (e.g., plastics, upholstery, rubber).
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Long-term or high-dose treatment with sodium nitroprusside, especially in individuals with chronic renal failure</span>
	- Sodium nitroprusside releases cyanide ions.
- Industrial: metal industry, manufacture of nitrogen-containing materials and products (plastics and wool), electroplating
## Pathophysiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cyanide blocks the electron transport chain by binding to cytochrome complex IV → ↓ oxidative phosphorylation → anaerobic metabolism, ↑ lactic acid, hypoxia</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Respiratory/Oxygen dissociation curve|Oxygen dissociation curve]] is usually normal (opposed to carbon monoxide poisoning)</span>
# Differential diagnostics
## Cyanide poisoning vs CO poisoning

# Management 
- Patient decontamination (e.g., remove clothes, wash skin)
- Administration of 100% oxygen regardless of saturation readings
- Supportive care
- Antidote 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hydroxocobalamin (precursor of [[../Biochemistry/Vitamin B12|vitamin B12]]): binds cyanide directly and forms cyanocobalamin, which is excreted in urine (first-line antidote)</span>
	- Sodium nitrite, amyl nitrite, or 4-dimethylaminophenol (4-DMAP) to induce [[../Respiratory/Methemoglobinemia|methemoglobinemia]] (via oxidation of Hb): Methemoglobin binds to cyanide to form cyanomethemoglobin, which diverts cyanide from cytochrome complex IV and increases oxidative phosphorylation.
	- Sodium thiosulfate: supplies sulfur donors to the mitochondrial enzyme rhodanese. Rhodanese detoxifies cyanide into thiocyanate, which is excreted in urine (usually coadministered with hydroxocobalamin).
