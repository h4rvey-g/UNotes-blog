- In warm AIHA - we have IgG which is much better fits for splenic macrophage FC receptor - so it causes more extravascular hemolysis.
- In cold AIHA IgM is much better activates [[../Immunology/Complement system|complement]] in the blood - intravascular hemolysis.

But basically they all cause some degree of both intra and extravascular hemolysis
