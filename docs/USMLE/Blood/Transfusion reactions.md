# Anaphylactic [[./Transfusion|transfusion]] reaction
- Pathophysiology
	- [[../Immunology/Type I hypersensitivity reaction|Type I hypersensitivity reaction]] in which <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">preformed IgE antibodies on the surface of mast cells bind to donor plasma proteins (commonly donor IgA in recipients with [[../Immunology/Selective IgA deficiency|IgA deficiency]])</span>, leading to mast cell degranulation
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Individuals with [[../Immunology/Selective IgA deficiency|IgA deficiency]] should receive IgA-depleted blood products.</span>
- Clinical features: Sudden onset during or up to 3 hours after the transfusion
	- Shock, hypotension, wheezing, respiratory distress
	- Skin reactions (e.g., pruritus, urticaria)
# Massive transfusion-related complications
## <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypocalcemia</span>
- Resulting from the binding of ionized calcium by citrate (an anticoagulant added to RBC, platelet, FFP, and whole blood transfusion units)
## Hyperkalemia
- Resulting from the lysis of RBCs in stored blood units
