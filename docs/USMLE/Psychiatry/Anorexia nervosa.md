# Clinical features
- Most patients present with a low BMI.
## Associated features of severe malnutrition
- CNS	
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypothermia</span>
		- This is thought to be caused by a disorder of the hypothalamic thermoregulatory centers.
	- Cortical atrophy with associated problems with concentration and reasoning
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Seizures </span>
		- As a result of dehydration and electrolyte imbalances
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Depressed mood, fatigue, and poor concentration</span>
- Cardiac	
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypotension</span>
