# Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI)
- Mechanism of action: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">inhibition of [[../Neurology/Neurotransmitters|serotonin]] reuptake in synaptic cleft → ↑ serotonin levels</span>
- Drugs
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fluoxetine</span>
	- Paroxetine
	- Sertraline
	- Citalopram
	- Escitalopram
	- Fluvoxamine
- Indications
	- [[./Major depressive disorder|Major depressive disorder]] (first-line therapy)
	- Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)
	- [[./Obsessive-compulsive disorder|Obsessive-compulsive disorder]] ([[./Obsessive-compulsive disorder|OCD]])
	- Post-traumatic stress disorder ([[./Trauma- and stressor-related disorders|PTSD]])
	- Panic disorder
	- Premature ejaculation
	- Premenstrual dysphoric disorder
	- Binge-eating disorder
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[./Bulimia nervosa|Bulimia nervosa]]</span>
	- Social anxiety disorder
- Side effects
	- Early side effects (onset and resolution typically within 1 week of therapy start)
		- Headache
		- [[../GI/Diarrhea|Diarrhea]], nausea, vomiting 
		- Activating effects (e.g., agitation, anxiety, insomnia) 
	- Late side effects 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sexual dysfunction (e.g., anorgasmia, ↓ libido, erectile or ejaculatory dysfunction)</span>
		- [[../Neurology/Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion|SIADH]]
		- [[../Neurology/Serotonin syndrome|Serotonin syndrome]]
			- Can be caused by any drug that increases serotonin levels
			- [[../Neurology/Serotonin syndrome|Serotonin syndrome]] caused by SSRIs alone typically manifests with mild symptoms (e.g., nausea, mild tremor).
			- Increased risk of occurrence and greater severity of symptoms when coadministered with another serotonergic agent (e.g., MAOIs)
			- Differential diagnosis: poisoning or overdose from concomitant use of substances (e.g., ethanol, salicylates) that may cause similar symptoms to [[../Neurology/Serotonin syndrome|serotonin syndrome]] (e.g., altered mental status)
		- Motor disorders (e.g., tremors, bruxism)
## Sertraline
- Ser for serotonin
- Sertraline has more GI side effects but is safe when pregnant or breastfeeding.

# Atypical antidepressants
## Mirtazapine
- Mechanism of action 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Selective α2-adrenergic antagonist → ↑ [[../Neurology/Neurotransmitters|serotonin]] and norepinephrine release</span>
	- 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptor antagonists → ↑ effect of serotonin on free 5-HT1 receptor is the likely cause of antidepressant action
	- H1 antagonist
- Indications: [[./Major depressive disorder|major depressive disorder]], especially in patients who are underweight and/or who have insomnia
- Side effects
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Appetite and weight gain</span>: can also be a desired effect
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sedation (due to H1 antagonism)</span>: can also be a desired effect
	- ↑ Serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels
	- Minimal sexual side effects
- Drug interactions: risk of [[../Neurology/Neurotransmitters|serotonin]] syndrome if used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs

- Indications
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Smoking cessation: used in conjunction with counseling and nicotine replacement</span> 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[./Major depressive disorder|Major depressive disorder]]</span>

	- Tachycardia, palpitations
	- Weight loss
	- Neuropsychiatric symptoms: insomnia, agitation, headache
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Reduction of seizure threshold: Bupropion should be avoided in patients at increased risk for seizure (e.g., history of epilepsy, anorexia/bulimia, alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal).</span>
	- Does not cause sexual side effects
	- Dry mouth
- Drug interactions: risk of [[../Neurology/Serotonin syndrome|serotonin syndrome]] if used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs
>[!tip] 
><span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Buproprion is not associated with sexual dysfunction or weight gain.</span> It is contraindicated in patients with seizure and eating disorders.
>- Because it does not affect serotonin.

# Monoamine oxidase inhibitors
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most powerful among these drugs, also has worst adverse effects</span>
- Mechanism of action 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Nonselective inhibition of monoamine oxidase → ↓ breakdown of epinephrine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine → ↑ levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine</span>
	- Selegiline: selective MAO-B inhibitor → mainly ↓ breakdown of dopamine → ↑ levels of dopamine

>[!tip] 
>Monoamines include dopamine, serotonin, and epinephrine.
- Drugs
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tranylcypromine</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Phenelzine</span>
	- Selegiline
- Indications
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[./Major depressive disorder|Major depressive disorder]] (third- or fourth-line therapy): particularly effective treatment for atypical depression</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[./Major depressive disorder|MDD]] with atypical features</span> is characterized by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">mood reactivity (ie, mood improves in response to positive events)</span>, leaden paralysis (ie, patient's arms and legs feel extremely heavy), rejection sensitivity (ie, overly sensitive to slight criticism), and the reversed vegetative signs of increased sleep and appetite.
	- [[../Neurology/Parkinson disease|Parkinson disease]]: selegiline (as an adjunct to carbidopa-levodopa)
- Side effects
	- CNS stimulation
	- Sexual dysfunction, can cause priapism
	- Orthostatic hypotension
	- Weight gain
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Cardiology/Hypertensive crises|Hypertensive crisis]] with ingestion of foods containing tyramine</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Examples: aged cheeses, smoked/cured meats, alcoholic beverages (especially beer and red wine), dried fruits, fava beans, chocolate</span>
		- Tyramine is an indirect sympathomimetic found in certain foods (eg, aged cheeses, cured meats, draft beer) that is <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">usually broken down in the gastrointestinal tract by MAO. In MAO inhibitor–treated patients, tyramine escapes degradation and enters the systemic circulation, leading to a [[../Cardiology/Hypertensive crises|hypertensive crisis]].</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tyramine stimulates the sympathetic nervous system by releasing other [[../Neurology/Neurotransmitters|neurotransmitters]], such as noradrenaline, from vesicles into the synaptic cleft.</span>

- Additional information
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Before starting new serotonergic drugs or ceasing dietary restrictions (e.g., foods containing tyramine), MAOI therapy has to be stopped for at least 2 weeks.</span>
		- To wait for MAO is resynthesized to a level adequate for normal monoamine degradation
