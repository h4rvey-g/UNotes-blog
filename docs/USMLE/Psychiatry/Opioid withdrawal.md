# Neonatal abstinence syndrome
Neonatal abstinence syndrome is caused by maternal drug use during [[../Reproductive/Pregnancy|pregnancy]] (typically [[../Pharmacology/Opioids|opioids]]) that subsequently leads to a withdrawal reaction in the infant.
## Clinical features 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Symptoms usually manifest in the first days of life.</span>
- Flu-like symptoms: fever and sweating
- Gastrointestinal symptoms
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Poor feeding</span>
	- Vomiting, [[../GI/Diarrhea|diarrhea]]
	- Failure to thrive
- Respiratory symptoms
	- Tachypnea, apnea
	- Sneezing, nasal congestion
- Sympathetic hyperactivity: hypertension, tachycardia
- CNS stimulation
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">High pitched crying, irritability</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Muscle tone and movement disorders (e.g., hyperreflexia, tremor, jerking)</span>
	- Seizures
	- Uncoordinated sucking reflexes

# Treatment
- Naloxone
	- A competitive <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">opioid receptor antagonist</span> with high binding affinity to the mu (Î¼) opioid receptor. 
	- Used to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">reverse [[../Neurology/Opioid overdose|opioid overdose]].</span> 
	- It has a relatively short duration of action, which can lead to renewed effect of [[../Pharmacology/Opioids|opioids]].
- Naltrexone
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Maintenance therapy for patients who have completed opioid withdrawal and want to abstain from opioid use</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Acute opioid withdrawal: methadone/buprenorphine</span>
	- Methadone 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">full mu-opioid receptor agonist</span>
		- It has a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">long half-life, which allows it to effectively suppress cravings and withdrawal symptoms</span>
		- It also blocks the euphoric effects of other [[../Pharmacology/Opioids|opioids]] by maintaining high tolerance levels
	- Buprenorphine is an <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">opioid partial agonist</span> used for opioid use disorder
