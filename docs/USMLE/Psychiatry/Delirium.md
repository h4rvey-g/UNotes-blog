# Epidemiology

# Etiology
---
## Risk factors
- Advanced age
- Neurologic disorder (e.g. [[../Neurology/Dementia|dementia]], stroke)
- Sensory impairment (e.g. [[../Neurology/Hearing loss|hearing loss]])
## Precipitating causes
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Drugs (eg, narcotics, sedatives, [[../Immunology/Antihistamines|antihistamines]], muscle relaxers, polypharmacy)</span>
- Infections (eg, [[../Respiratory/Pneumonia|pneumonia]], urinary tract infection, [[../Infective disease/Meningitis|meningitis]])
- Electrolyte disturbances (eg, hyponatremia, [[../Cardiology/Hypercalcemia|hypercalcemia]])
- Metabolic derangements (eg, volume depletion, [[../Biochemistry/Vitamin B12|vitamin B12 deficiency]], hyperglycemia)
- Systemic illnesses (eg, [[../Cardiology/Congestive heart failure|congestive heart failure]], hepatic failure, malignancy)
- CNS conditions (eg, seizure, stroke, head injury, subdural hematoma)

- Differential diagnostics

# Treatment
---
## Treatment of agitation in delirium
- Agitation should initially be managed with nonpharmacologic strategies.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Avoid physical restraints as much as possible in older patients</span> with delirium, as they can worsen distress and agitation, as well as contribute to preventable injuries.
- Pharmacotherapy
	- [[./Antipsychotics|Antipsychotics]]
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Typical [[./Antipsychotics|antipsychotics]]: e.g., haloperidol (most commonly used)</span>
		- Atypical [[./Antipsychotics|antipsychotic]] options
			- Risperidone
			- Olanzapine

>[!warning] 
>- Avoid [[./Antipsychotics|antipsychotics]] in patients with underlying [[./Alcohol withdrawal|alcohol withdrawal]] or benzodiazepine withdrawal (due to the risk of seizures) and in patients at high risk for QTc prolongation (due to the risk of [[../Cardiology/Torsades de pointes|torsades de pointes]]).
>- [[./Sedative-hypnotic drugs|Benzodiazepines]] are deliriogenic. Do not treat delirious patients with [[./Sedative-hypnotic drugs|benzodiazepines]] unless the delirium is due to alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal.
