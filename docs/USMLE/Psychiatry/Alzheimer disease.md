# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
## Amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene
- Linked to 10–15% of early-onset familial AD cases
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Since the APP gene is located on chromosome 21, individuals with [[../Biochemistry/Down syndrome|trisomy 21]] have an increased risk of early-onset AD due to APP overexpression </span>
- Age at disease onset usually resembles parental age at disease onset (median ∼ 49 years).
## Presenilin-1 	
- Earlier onset compared to AD due to mutations of other genes (median is ∼ 43 years)
## Apo ε 	
- Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)
- Risk of late-onset AD increases with the number of carried Apo ε4 alleles.
- Apo ε2 alleles may have a protective effect (reduce the risk of late-onset sporadic AD).

# Diagnostics
## MRI brain
- Indication: all patients as part of the initial evaluation of major neurocognitive disorder
- Supportive findings
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Signs of generalized or focal cerebral atrophy </span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Enlarged ventricles (ventriculomegaly)</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Narrowing of gyri</span>
		- Prominent cerebral sulci (hydrocephalus ex vacuo)
	- Disproportionate atrophy of the medial temporal lobe including the hippocampi, amygdala, cingulate cortex, and parahippocampal gyrus

Multiple small hyperintense foci in the white matter (examples outlined) are enlarged perivascular spaces (Virchow-Robin spaces).
# Pathology
## Macroscopic
- Cerebral atrophy
	- Damage to the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex (medial temporal lobe structures) is the earliest gross pathological change.
	- Degeneration of cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert
	- Diffuse cortical atrophy occurs as the disease progresses.

# Treatment
## Pharmacological treatment

	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Mild to moderate AD (first-line)</span>
	- Reversible cholinesterase inhibition → ↑ ACh concentration at the synaptic gap
	- Adverse effects
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Nausea, vomiting</span>
		- Dizziness
		- Insomnia
		- Cholinergic crisis
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bradycardia, conduction abnormalities</span>

	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Moderate to severe AD</span>; Often used in combination with donepezil
	- NMDA receptor antagonism → ↓ glutamate-induced calcium-mediated excitotoxicity
