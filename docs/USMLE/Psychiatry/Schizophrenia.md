# Differential diagnosis
- Schizophrenia: ≥ 6 months
- Schizophreniform disorder: 1–6 months
- Brief psychotic disorder: > 1 day but ≤ 1 month
	- Brief psychotic disorder usually develops after stressful life events.
- [[./Schizoaffective disorder|Schizoaffective disorder]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">≥ 2 weeks of psychosis without prominent manic/depressive symptoms during the illness episode</span>, to differentiate from a mood disorder with psychotic features (Like [[./Major depressive disorder|MDD]])
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">They don't have psychotic symptoms alone without mood symptoms</span>
	- A single illness episode where both of the following occur concurrently:
		- Psychotic symptoms that meet the criteria for schizophrenia
		- Features of a major mood episode (major depressive episode OR manic episode OR mixed episode)
	- Psychotic symptoms occur at least once in the absence of mood disorder symptoms.
- Delusional disorder
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">≥ 1 month</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">At least one delusion</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">No other prominent psychotic symptoms</span> (e.g., hallucinations, disorganized speech, negative symptoms) 
	- E.g., delusional parasitosis: the fixed belief that the body is infested with a parasite despite the lack of supporting evidence
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Social and occupational functioning are not markedly impaired (vs psychosis)</span>
