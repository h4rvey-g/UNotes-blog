## Noninvasive carcinomas
### Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
- Characteristics
	- No penetration of the basement membrane
	- Preceded by ductal atypia
	- Frequently appears as a pattern of grouped <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">microcalcifications</span> on mammography
	- Higher risk of subsequent ipsilateral invasive carcinoma
- Comedocarcinoma
	- Characteristics: subtype of DCIS characterized by central necrosis 

>[!tip] 
>Noninvasive carcinomas are characterized by the absence of stromal invasion.
## Invasive carcinomas
### Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)
- Characteristics
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most common type of invasive breast cancer (∼ 80%) </span>
	- Aggressive formation of metastases
- Localization
	- Unilateral
	- Mostly unifocal
#### Medullary breast cancer 
- Characteristics
	- Rare subtype of invasive ductal carcinoma
	- Most common tumor associated with the BRCA1 mutation
	- Well-circumscribed soft tumor with smooth borders (may appear benign)
	- Usually triple-negative
	- Lymphadenopathy 
- Differential diagnosis: fibroadenoma
### Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) 
- Characteristics
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">∼ 10% of all invasive breast carcinomas</span>
	- Less aggressive than ductal carcinoma
- Localization
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bilateral</span> in ∼ 20% of cases
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Frequently multifocal</span>
# Clinical features
---
## Locally advanced disease
- Skin
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Retractions or dimpling</span> (due to fixation to the pectoral muscles, deep fascia, Cooper ligaments, and/or overlying skin)
	- Peau d'orange (see below)
# Subtypes and variants
---
## Paget disease of the breast
- Definition: a rare type of breast cancer that <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">affects the lactiferous ducts and the skin of the nipple and areola</span>
- Pathogenesis: migratory/epidermotropic theory: neoplastic ductal epithelial cells from an underlying DCIS or IDC  move through the lactiferous ducts and invade the surrounding epidermis of the nipple.
- Clinical features![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240412145835.png|Pasted image 20240412145835.png]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Erythematous, scaly, or vesicular rash affecting the nipple and areola</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pruritus; burning sensation</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Nipple retraction</span>
	- Ulceration that causes blood-tinged [[./Nipple discharge|nipple discharge]]
- Diagnostics
	- Punch/wedge or surface biopsy of nipple tissue: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Paget cells</span> confirm disease.
## Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC)
- Definition: a rare form of advanced, aggressive invasive carcinoma <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">characterized by dermal lymphatic invasion of tumor cells</span>
- Clinical features![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240416202309.png|Pasted image 20240416202309.png]]
	- Peau d'orange
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Erythematous, warm, and edematous skin plaques with prominent hair follicles that resemble orange peel</span>
		- Caused by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">obstruction of the lymphatic channels</span> due to tumor growth  
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tenderness</span>, burning sensation
	- Blood-tinged nipple discharge
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Signs of metastatic disease (e.g., axillary lymphadenopathy)</span> 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Usually no palpable mass</span>
- Differential diagnosis
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Mastitis</span>
		- Fever
		- No Peau d'orange
		- Good response to antibiotics
	- Paget disease of the breast
	- Breast abscess

>[!tip] 
>It is called inflammatory breast cancer because its appearance resembles inflammation, but there is actually no inflammation!
# Diagnostics
---
## Receptor testing
![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240311145001.png|Pasted image 20240311145001.png]]
- Hormone receptors (HR) positive
	- [[./Androgen and estrogen synthesis|Estrogen]] receptor
	- Progestogen receptor
- Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu, c-erbB2) positive
- Triple negative
### Prognosis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hormone-negative breast cancer has a poorer prognosis than hormone-positive breast cancer. </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">HER2-positive tumors show aggressive growth and metastasize quickly compared to HER2-negative tumors. </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Triple-negative disease is associated with a poor prognosis.</span>
