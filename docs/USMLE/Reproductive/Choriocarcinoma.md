- Definition
	- A highly malignant gestational trophoblastic disease characterized by invasive, highly vascular, and anaplastic trophoblastic tissue without villi.
	- Has the tendency to metastasize to the lungs, vagina, CNS, liver, pelvis, GI tract, and kidneys
- Etiology: Choriocarcinoma is preceded by: 
	- [[./Hydatidiform mole|Hydatidiform mole]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Spontaneous abortion</span> or [[./Ectopic pregnancy|ectopic pregnancy]]
- Pathophysiology
	- Malignant transformation of cytotrophoblastic and syncytiotrophoblastic tissue
	- Destructive growth into myometrium without chorionic villi → risk of hemorrhage and early metastasis (lung, vagina, brain, liver) 
- Clinical features: depend on disease extension and metastases location
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Postpartum vaginal bleeding and inadequate uterine regression after delivery</span>
	- Additional symptoms according to the site of metastasis e.g.:
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dyspnea, cough, or hemoptysis from metastases in the lungs</span>
		- Seizures, [[../Neurology/Headaches|headaches]] from metastases in the brain
		- Visible vascular lesions from metastases to the vagina
	- [[./Human chorionic gonadotropin|β-hCG]]-mediated endocrine conditions (e.g., [[../Endocrine/Hyperthyroidism|hyperthyroidism]], theca lutein cysts)
- Diagnostics
	- [[./Human chorionic gonadotropin|β-HCG]] levels: very high (initial test of choice)
	- Chest x-ray
