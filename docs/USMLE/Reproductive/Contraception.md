# Hormonal contraception
## Mechanism of action for hormonal contraceptives
- Estrogen: suppresses release of GnRH from the hypothalamus → ↓ release of pituitary gonadotropins (FSH, LH)
	- Decreased FSH → prevents ovarian folliculogenesis 
	- Decreased LH → inhibition of ovulation 
- Progestin: synthetic progesterone → 
	- Inhibits GnRH and LH secretion → suppressed ovulation (main contraceptive mechanism) 
	- Inhibits endometrial proliferation → decreases chance of embryo implantation 
	- Changes cervical mucus (↓ volume and ↑ viscosity) and impairs fallopian tube peristalsis → inhibits sperm migration and embryo implantation
