# Pathophysiology
- In endometriosis, endometrial tissue occurs <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">outside of the uterus.</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">It's adenomyosis if in uterus.</span>
- Common locations of endometriotic implants include:
	- Pelvic organs
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ovaries: most common site; often affected bilaterally</span>
		- Rectouterine pouch
		- Fallopian tubes
		- Bladder
		- Cervix
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Peritoneum</span>
	- Extrapelvic organs (e.g., lung or diaphragm): less commonly affected 
- Regardless of where the endometrial tissue is located, it <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">reacts to the hormone cycle</span> in much the same way as the endometrium and proliferates under the influence of estrogen.
- Endometriotic implants result in:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Production of inflammatory and pain mediators</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anatomical changes (e.g., pelvic adhesions) → infertility</span>

# Clinical features
## General
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Chronic pelvic pain that worsens before the onset of menses</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Infertility</span>
	- Endometriosis <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">causes inflammation and adhesions that can change pelvic anatomy, altering egg quality and impairing implantation</span>. 25–50% of infertile women have endometriosis.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dysmenorrhea</span>
- Pre- or postmenstrual bleeding
- Dyspareunia
## Intestines
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dyschezia</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../GI/Diarrhea|Diarrhea]]</span>
- Constipation
- Rectal bleeding

# Diagnostics

# Differential diagnosis
## Adenomyosis
- Definition: benign disease characterized by the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">occurrence of endometrial tissue within the myometrium due to hyperplasia of the endometrial basal layer</span>
- Epidemiology: peak incidence at 35–50 years
- Clinical features
	- May be asymptomatic 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dysmenorrhea</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[./Abnormal uterine bleeding|Abnormal uterine bleeding]]</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Chronic pelvic pain, aggravated during menses</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Globular, uniformly enlarged uterus that is soft but tender on palpation</span>
		- Differ from [[./Uterine leiomyoma|Uterine leiomyoma]], which shows irregularly enlarged, firm uterine
- Diagnostics
	- Diagnosis is clinical and may be supported by transvaginal ultrasound and MRI findings
		- Asymmetric myometrial wall thickening 
		- Myometrial cysts

# Pathology
## Macroscopic findings
- Ovaries
	- Gunshot lesions or powder-burn lesions
		- Black, yellow-brown, or bluish nodules or cystic structures
		- Seen on the serosal surfaces of the ovaries and peritoneum
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ovarian endometriomas or chocolate cysts: cyst-like structures that contain blood, fluid, and menstrual debris</span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240202112836.png|Pasted image 20240202112836.png]]![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240202112909.png|Pasted image 20240202112909.png]]

# Treatment
- Mild to moderate pelvic pain without complications
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Empiric treatment with [[../Pharmacology/Non-opioid analgesics|NSAIDs]] and continuous hormonal [[./Contraception|contraceptives]]</span> 
	- [[../Pharmacology/Non-opioid analgesics|NSAIDs]] alone if pregnancy is desired 
	- Synthetic androgens (e.g., danazol) 
- Severe symptoms: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Pharmacology/Hypothalamic and pituitary drugs|GnRH agonists]]</span> (e.g., buserelin, goserelin) and estrogen-progestin OCPs 
	- OCPs are to avoid hypoestrogenic side effects
