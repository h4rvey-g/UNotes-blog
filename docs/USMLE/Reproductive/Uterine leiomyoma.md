# Epidemiology

# Etiology
## Predisposing factors
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Nulliparity</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Early menarche (&lt; 10 years of age)</span>
- Age: 25â€“45 years
	- Fibroids are <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">largely found in women of reproductive age.</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Influenced by hormones</span> (i.e., estrogen, growth hormone, and progesterone)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">During [[./Menopause|menopause]], hormone levels begin to decrease and leiomyomas begin to shrink.</span>
- Increased incidence in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">African American individuals </span>

# Pathophysiology


---
# Clinical features
Symptoms depend on the number, size, and location of leiomyomas. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most women have small, asymptomatic fibroids.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Abnormal menstruation</span> (possibly associated with anemia): <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hypermenorrhea</span>, heavy menstrual bleeding, metrorrhagia, dysmenorrhea
	- Submucosal leiomyomas are most frequently associated with significantly prolonged or heavy menstrual bleeding. The mechanism may be related to the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased total surface area as a result of the bulging uterine wall, impaired uterine wall contractility, or micro/macrovascular abnormalities.</span>
- Features of mass effect
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Enlarged, firm and irregular uteru</span>s during bimanual pelvic examination 
		- Size can range from normal to full-term gestation
		- Differ from [[./Endometriosis|Adenomyosis]], which shows globular, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">uniformly enlarged</span> uterus that is soft but tender on palpation
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Back or pelvic pain/discomfort </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Urinary tract or bowel symptoms</span> (e.g., urinary frequency/retention/incontinence, constipation, features of hydronephrosis) 
- Reproductive abnormalities
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Infertility (difficulty conceiving and increased risk of [[./Pregnancy|pregnancy]] loss) </span>
		- Related to an obstructed uterine cavity and/or impaired contractility of the uterus.
	- Dyspareunia

# Diagnostics
>[!warning] 
>Uterine leiomyomas are extremely common (affecting 70% of women) and are often found incidentally on ultrasound; do not attribute abnormal uterine bleeding to leiomyomas until other etiologies have been ruled out!
## Pathology
- Macroscopic
	- Grayish-white surface
	- Homogeneous; tissue bundles on cross-section partly in a whorled pattern
	- Some leiomyomas may involve regressive changes: scar formation, calcification, and cysts
- Microscopic: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Smooth muscle tissue in a whorled pattern with well-demarcated borders, consisting of monoclonal cells interspersed with connective tissue</span>

## Uterine leiomyosarcoma (uterine sarcoma)
Rare malignant tumor arising from the smooth muscle cells of the myometrium
- Risk factors
	- Menopause
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[./Selective estrogen receptor modulators|Tamoxifen]] use</span>
		- Because it stimulate the ER on uterine myometrium
- Uterine findings
	- Rapidly enlarging
- Pathology
	- Single lesions with areas of coagulative necrosis and/or hemorrhage
	- Cords of polygonal cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">abundant mitoses, and cellular atypia</span> are common.
