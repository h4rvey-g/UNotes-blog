# Epidemiology

# Etiology
- Typically idiopathic (âˆ¼ 70% of cases) 
- Fetal anomalies
	- Gastrointestinal (e.g., esophageal atresia, [[../GI/Intestinal atresia|duodenal atresia]] and stenosis): reduced swallowing and absorption of amniotic fluid
	- CNS: anencephaly (leads to impaired swallowing of amniotic fluid, leakage of cerebrospinal fluid, and increased urination due to lack of fetal ADH), meningomyelocele (due to leakage of cerebrospinal fluid)
	- Pulmonary: cystic lung malformations
	- Multiple pregnancy: twin-to-twin [[../Blood/Transfusion|transfusion]] syndrome 
- Maternal conditions
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Endocrine/Diabetes mellitus|Diabetes mellitus]] </span>
		- Increased maternal glucose levels increase fetal glucose levels as well, resulting in polyuria.
	- Rh incompatibility
