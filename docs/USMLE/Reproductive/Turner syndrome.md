 Chromosomal nondisjunction → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">chromosome X</span> monosomy/mosaicism → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">impaired ovarian development → malfunctioning streak gonads with connective tissue instead of normal germ cells → estrogen and progesterone deficiencies</span>
- Karyotype
	- Meiotic nondisjunction (most often in paternal gametes) → complete sex chromosomal monosomy (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">45,XO</span>; no Barr body)
		- Barr body: The inactive X chromosome present in all female somatic cells. Appears as a small, dark-staining spot at the periphery of the nucleus. Consists of tightly-packed, transcriptionally-inactive, heterochromatin.
	- Mitotic nondisjunction of an embryonic cell → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">sex chromosomal mosaicism (45,XO/46,XX)</span> → mild phenotypic expression

	- Lymphedema of the hands and feet in the neonatal period
- Musculoskeletal findings
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Short stature</span>: due to the presence of only one copy of the SHOX (short stature homeobox) gene, normally located on the X chromosome 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Scoliosis are common</span>
	- Shield chest: broad chest with widely spaced nipples

	- Low-set posterior hairline
	- Osteoporosis and pathologic fractures 
- Cardiovascular abnormalities
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bicuspid aortic valve: increased risk of premature aortic stenosis and/or insufficiency </span>
		- As a result of valve calcification.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Cardiology/Coarctation of the aorta|Coarctation of the aorta]]</span> with brachial-femoral delay
