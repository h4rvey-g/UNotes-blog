# Pathophysiology
## Menstrual irregularities and amenorrhea
- ↓ Ovarian function from age-related ovarian follicle loss leads to:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ Estrogen and progesterone levels → loss of negative feedback on the pituitary gland → ↑ GnRH levels → ↑ FSH and LH levels (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism)</span>
	- ↑ In anovulatory cycles 
		- As the ovaries age, they become less responsive to gonadotropin stimulation.
- Ovarian function eventually ceases.
- Iatrogenic removal of the ovaries leads to abrupt cessation of ovarian function.
## Vasomotor symptoms
- Hypothalamic thermoregulatory zone narrows → small temperature changes trigger compensatory reactions
- ↓ Estrogen is associated with ↑ norepinephrine and ↓ serotonin
## Genitourinary symptoms
- Hypoestrogenism → vaginal and vulvar epithelial atrophy, as well as urethral and bladder atrophy
	- Estrogen has positive effects on [[../Biochemistry/Collagen|collagen]] and the epithelial surface.

# Clinical features
## Menstrual abnormalities
- Irregular menses that gradually decrease in frequency until complete amenorrhea
## Vasomotor symptoms of menopause (VMS)
- Increased sweating
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hot flashes</span>
- Heat intolerance
- Seen in ∼ 75% of individuals during perimenopause and menopause
- On average, vasomotor symptoms last for ∼ 7 years.
## Other symptoms
- Osteoporosis
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Develops at least 10-15 years after cessation of menses</span>

# Diagnostics
## Supportive studies to confirm menopause
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">FSH: ↑↑</span>; however, levels widely fluctuate during perimenopause
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Estradiol: ↓ </span>
- Rarely tested for as not routinely recommended: ↓ progesterone, ↓ inhibin B, and ↓ antimüllerian hormone
## Studies to exclude differential diagnoses of menopause
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pregnancy test: to rule out pregnancy as a cause of amenorrhea</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Prolactin: elevated in [[../Endocrine/Hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia]]</span>
- LH: elevated in POI
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">TSH: Both [[../Biochemistry/Hypothyroidism|hypothyroidism]] and [[../Endocrine/Hyperthyroidism|hyperthyroidism]] can cause menstrual irregularities.</span>
