><font color="#ffc000">↑LH → ↑↑↑[[./Androgen and estrogen synthesis|androgen]], beyond the conversion capacity to [[./Androgen and estrogen synthesis|estrogen]] → ↑↑↑androgen inhibits FSH, causing more LH → no LH surge, oligoovulation/anovulation</font>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Strong association with obesity → ↑ in peripheral estrogen synthesis from adipose tissue and ↓ in peripheral sensitivity to insulin</span>
	- Estrogen is also produced in other aromatase-containing tissues: Fatty tissue, Placenta

# Treatment
- Target BMI < 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (can reduce estrone production in the adipose tissue)
## Patients not planning to conceive
For patients who do not wish to conceive, the therapeutic goals are to control menstrual irregularities and hyperandrogenism, treat comorbidities, and improve quality of life.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Combined oral [[./Contraception|contraceptives]] (COCs) </span>
	- Indication: first-line treatment for hyperandrogenism and/or menstrual cycle abnormalities 
		- Additional benefits
			- ↓ Endometrial hyperplasia → ↓ risk of endometrial carcinoma 
			- ↓ Menstrual bleeding
			- ↓ [[../MSK/Acne vulgaris|Acne]]
			- Treatment of hirsutism
				- COCs increase the production of SHBG, which binds excess androgen.
- Metformin: improves menstrual irregularities, metabolic outcomes, and weight (especially when combined with lifestyle modifications)
## Patients planning to conceive
Management of comorbidities (e.g., weight loss for overweight or obese patients) and induction of ovulation.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Letrozole (off-label): first-line therapy for ovulation induction </span>
	- An [[./Androgen and estrogen synthesis|aromatase inhibitor]]
	- Improves [[./Pregnancy|pregnancy]] and live birth rates in patients with anovulatory infertility with no other causes
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Mechanism of action: aromatase inhibition reduces estrogen production, stimulating FSH secretion and inducing ovulation</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[./Selective estrogen receptor modulators|Clomiphene]]</span>: alternative to letrozole
- Exogenous gonadotropins: The low-dose regimen is the second-line treatment for ovulation induction.
	- Agents: exogenous FSH and human menopausal gonadotropin
- Metformin
	- Can be used as second-line monotherapy for fertility treatment.  
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Combination with [[./Selective estrogen receptor modulators|clomiphene]] may increase pregnancy rates, especially in obese women.</span>
