# hCG physiology
- The role of hCG is to:  
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Stimulate progesterone secretion by the corpus luteum during the first 3–6 weeks of gestation to maintain pregnancy</span>  
		- Prior to pregnancy, LH stimulates corpus luteal progesterone secretion.  
		- After the luteal placental shift, the placenta produces progesterone.  
	- Promote uterine angiogenesis
	- Promote myometrial stability, preventing contractions prior to labor
	- Support immune tolerance to the growing embryo 
- Structure
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">α-subunit: common to hCG, FSH, LH, and TSH </span>
	- β-subunit
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Specific to hCG </span>
		- Pregnancy tests generally detect hCG through antibodies to the β-subunit.
