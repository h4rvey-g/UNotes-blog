- Reactions tend to be systemic, as immune complexes are distributed via circulation throughout the body.
# Pathophysiology
1. Antigen (e.g., the molecules of a drug in circulation) binds to IgG to form an immune complex (antigen-antibody complex) 
2. Immune complexes are deposited in tissue, especially blood vessels → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">initiation of [[./Complement system|complement]] cascade → release of lysosomal enzymes from neutrophils → cell death → inflammation → [[../MSK/Vasculitides|vasculitis]]</span>
