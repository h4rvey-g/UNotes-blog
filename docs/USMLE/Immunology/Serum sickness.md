Serum sickness is a classic example of a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">type III hypersensitivity reaction</span>, which usually develops as a complication of antitoxin or antivenom administration.
# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Antivenom or antitoxin containing animal proteins or serum</span> (→ “serum” sickness), such as:
	- Equine anti-snake venom
	- Equine anti-spider venom
	- Equine or bovine anti-rabies antitoxin
	- Equine botulinum antitoxin
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Medications: most frequently antibiotics (e.g., penicillin, amoxicillin, cefaclor, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) </span>
- Infections: Hepatitis B virus

# Pathophysiology
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Exposure to an antigen (e.g., antivenom, drug) → formation of antibodies → deposition of antibody-antigen complexes in tissue → activation of the complement cascade → tissue damage and systemic inflammation</span>

# Clinical features
- Fever
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Rash (urticarial or purpuric)</span>
- Arthralgias, myalgia
- Lymphadenopathy
>[!tip] 
><span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Symptoms appear 1–3 weeks following initial exposure</span> (because antibodies take several days to form) and typically resolve within a few weeks after discontinuation of the offending agent.

# Diagnostics
# Differential Diagnostics
## Serum sickness-like reaction
- Epidemiology: much more common than actual serum sickness
- Etiology: similar to that of serum sickness
	- Infections (e.g., hepatitis B, rabies)
	- Medications that can act as haptens (e.g., allopurinol, cephalosporins, penicillin)
- Pathogenesis: unclear (likely not the result of a type III hypersensitivity reaction)
- Clinical features
	- Similar to classic serum sickness
