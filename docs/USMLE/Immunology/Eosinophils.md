- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Parasitic defense</span>: Eosinophil proliferation and activation during multicellular parasitic infection is stimulated by IL-5 produced by TH2 and mast cells (not to be confused with IL-4, which stimulates IgE production).  When a parasite invades the mucosa or enters the bloodstream, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">it is coated by IgG and IgA antibodies that bind the Fc receptors located on the eosinophil cell surface.</span>  This triggers eosinophil degranulation and release of cytotoxic proteins (eg, major basic protein) and reactive oxygen intermediates, substances that damage and destroy antibody-bound parasites.  This mechanism is an example of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)</span>, which is also used by macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Type I hypersensitivity reactions</span>: Eosinophils also synthesize prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and cytokines that contribute to the inflammation seen in late-phase type 1 hypersensitivity and chronic allergic reactions.
