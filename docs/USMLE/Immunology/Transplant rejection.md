# Pathophysiology
## Hyperacute rejection
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Humoral rejection (type II hypersensitivity reaction)</span>: recipient's <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">preformed cytotoxic antibodies against donor's class I HLA molecules or blood group antigens </span>→ activation of the [[./Complement system|complement system]] and adhesion to cells → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">thrombosis of vessels → graft ischemia and necrosis</span>
- Preformed antibodies against HLA antigens result from exposure to foreign HLA haplotypes during [[../Reproductive/Pregnancy|pregnancy]], [[../Blood/Transfusion|transfusion]], or a previously rejected transplant.
## Acute rejection
- Allorecognition → T [[../Blood/Lymphocyte|lymphocyte]] induced cell-mediated and/or humoral immunity
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Acute cellular rejection ([[./Type IV hypersensitivity reaction|type IV hypersensitivity reaction]])</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Donor MHC class II antigens react with recipient CD4+ T cells</span>, which then differentiate into Th1 helper T cells → cytokine (INF-γ) release → macrophage recruitment → parenchymal and endothelial inflammation
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Donor MHC class I antigens react with recipient CD8+ T cells</span> → direct cytotoxic cell damage
- Acute humoral rejection (type II hypersensitivity reaction): recipient antibodies, formed before or after transplantation, react against donor HLA antigens
## Chronic rejection
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Combination of humoral rejection (type II hypersensitivity reaction) and cellular rejection ([[./Type IV hypersensitivity reaction|type IV hypersensitivity reaction]])</span>
- Donor MHC class II antigens react with recipient CD4+ T cells → differentiation into Th1 helper T cells → cytokine (INF-γ) release → macrophage recruitment → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">parenchymal and endothelial inflammation</span>
# Graft-versus-host disease

## Etiology
- Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is common in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">transplantation of lymphocyte-rich organs</span>, including:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation </span>
	- Transfusion of nonirradiated blood products
- HLA mismatch (especially HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DR) is associated with an increased risk of GvHD.
