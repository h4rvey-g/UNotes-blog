# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- Genetic predisposition
	- HLA-DR2 and [[./HLA system|HLA-DR3]] are commonly present in individuals with SLE.
	- Genetic deficiency of classical pathway [[./Complement system|complement]] proteins (C1q, C2, C4) in approx. 10% of affected individuals
- Hormonal factors: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hyperestrogenic states (e.g., due to oral contraceptive use, postmenopausal hormonal therapy</span>, [[../Reproductive/Endometriosis|endometriosis]]) are associated with an increased risk of SLE.
- Environmental factors
	- Cigarette smoking and silica exposure increase the risk of developing SLE.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">UV light and [[../Infective disease/Infectious mononucleosis|EBV]] infection may trigger disease flares</span>, but there is insufficient evidence on whether they cause SLE.
	- Drugs such as procainamide or hydralazine (see “[[../Cardiology/Drug-induced lupus erythematosus|Drug-induced lupus erythematosus]]”)

# Pathophysiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Autoantibody development: deficiency of classical [[./Complement system|complement]] proteins (C1q, C4, C2) → failure of macrophages to phagocytose immune complexes and apoptotic cell material (i.e., plasma and nuclear antigens) → dysregulated, intolerant lymphocytes targeting normally hidden intracellular antigens → autoantibody production (e.g., ANA, anti-dsDNA) </span>
	- Normally, apoptotic cells are engulfed by macrophages during apoptosis, avoiding the release of intracellular content that induces inflammation or an immune response in the extracellular environment.
- Autoimmune reactions
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Type III hypersensitivity (most common in SLE) → antibody-antigen complex formation in microvasculature → [[./Complement system|complement]] activation and inflammation → damage to skin, kidneys, joints, small vessels</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Type II hypersensitivity → IgG and IgM antibodies directed against antigens on cells (e.g., red blood cells) → cytopenia</span>

# Clinical features
- SLE is a systemic disease characterized by phases of remission and relapse.
- SLE can affect any organ.
## Common
- Constitutional: fatigue, fever, weight loss
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Joints (> 90% of cases)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Arthritis and arthralgia</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Distal symmetrical polyarthritis: most commonly affects the joints of the fingers, carpal joints, and the knee</span>
- Skin (85% of cases)
	- Malar rash (butterfly rash): flat or raised fixed erythema over both malar eminences (nasolabial folds tend to be spared) 
	- Raynaud phenomenon
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Photosensitivity → maculopapular rash </span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231212100519.png|Pasted image 20231212100519.png]]
	- Discoid rash  
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Oral ulcers (usually painless)</span>
	- Nonscarring [[../MSK/Alopecia|alopecia]] (except with discoid rashes)
	- Periungual telangiectasia 

>[!tip] 
>Both [[../MSK/Rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis]] and SLE arthritis affect the MCP and PIP joints, but SLE does not usually lead to deformities.
## Less common
- Kidneys: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">nephritis with proteinuria (see “[[../Renal/Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis|Lupus nephritis]]”)</span>
	- Mesangial and/or subendothelial deposition of immune complexes (e.g., anti-dsDNA antibodies, anti-Sm antibodies) → expansion and thickening of mesangium, capillary walls, and/or glomerular basement membrane
- Heart
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pericarditis, myocarditis, endocarditis (Libman-Sacks endocarditis)</span>
	- Aortic valve lesions
	- [[../Cardiology/Coronary artery disease|Coronary artery disease]] 
# Diagnostics

## Laboratory studies
![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240116151535.png|Pasted image 20240116151535.png]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs)</span>
	- Positive titers of ≥ 1:80 have <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">∼ 98% sensitivity for SLE</span>
- Antigen-specific ANAs: Request only if ANAs are positive.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anti-dsDNA antibodies</span>
		- Autoantibodies against double-stranded DNA
		- Positive in 60–70% of patients
		- Highly specific for SLE
		- Levels correlate with disease activity (especially [[../Renal/Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis|lupus nephritis]] activity). 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anti-Sm antibodies</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Autoantibodies against Smith antigens (nonhistone nuclear proteins)</span>
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Smith can bond to snRNAs to form snRNPs, which can form a spliceosome.</span>
		- Positive in < 30% of patients, but highly specific for SLE
- Antiphospholipid antibodies: Screen all patients for [[../MSK/Antiphospholipid syndrome|antiphospholipid syndrome]].
- Laboratory markers of disease activity and/or organ damage in SLE
	- [[./Complement system|Complement]] levels: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ C3 and/or ↓ C4 in patients with active disease, factor B levels remain normal </span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240224215441.png|Pasted image 20240224215441.png]]
		- Antigen-antibody complexes trigger classic pathway, which decreases C3 and C4. But factor B in alternative pathway is intact.

## Skin biopsy
- Lupus band test (LBT): a direct [[../Renal/Immunofluorescence|immunofluorescence]] staining technique used to detect immunoglobulin and [[./Complement system|complement]] component deposits along the dermoepidermal junction in affected and unaffected skin in patients with SLE![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231029092317.png|Pasted image 20231029092317.png]]
