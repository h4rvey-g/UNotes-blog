- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lung compliance increases ("loose, baggy lungs") due to loss of elastin content.  This process resembles mild emphysema and leads to dynamic expiratory airflow obstruction, premature airway closure, and progressive hyperinflation.</span>
- Chest wall compliance decreases ("stiff rib cage") due to degenerative changes (ossification, arthritis) of the sternocostal and costovertebral joints and kyphosis of the thoracic spine.
- Total respiratory system compliance, the combination of lung parenchymal and chest wall compliance, is decreased because the stiffness of the chest wall dominates over the increased laxity of the lung.

Common medications to avoid in older adults
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anticholinergic (cause urinary retention and constipation)</span>
	- First-generation [[../Immunology/Antihistamines|antihistamines]]
		- Also has strong sedative effect
	- Gastrointestinal antispasmodics
- Cardiovascular (may elevate the risk of orthostatic hypotension)
	- Alpha-1 blockers (as antihypertensives)
	- Centrally acting alpha-2 agonists
	- Many [[../Pharmacology/Antiarrhythmic drugs|antiarrhythmics]]
- CNS (can cause sedation, cognitive impairment, and/or [[../Psychiatry/Delirium|delirium]] → ↑ risk of falls and fractures)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tricyclic [[../Psychiatry/Antidepressants|antidepressants]]</span>
	- [[../Psychiatry/Antipsychotics|Antipsychotics]]
	- Barbiturates, [[../Psychiatry/Sedative-hypnotic drugs|benzodiazepines]] & other hypnotics
- Endocrine (increased risk of [[../Endocrine/Hypoglycemia|hypoglycemia]])
	- Long-acting sulfonylureas
	- Sliding-scale insulin
		- Doses are not consistent
- Pain (risk of GI bleeding and [[../Renal/Acute kidney injury|AKI]])
	- Nonselective [[../Pharmacology/Non-opioid analgesics|NSAIDs]]
	- Skeletal muscle relaxants
