# Proto-oncogenes (tumor promoters)
- ABL: [[../Blood/Chronic myeloid leukemia|Chronic myeloid leukemia]]
- ALK: Large cell lymphoma, non–small cell [[../Respiratory/Lung cancer|lung cancer]]
- BRAF: [[../MSK/Melanoma|Melanoma]]
	- RAF is rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma
- BCL-2: Follicular lymphoma(t(14;18)), Diffuse large B cell lymphoma
	- <font color="#ffc000">BCL</font>-2 mutations are associated with diffuse large <font color="#ffc000">B</font>-<font color="#ffc000">c</font>ell <font color="#ffc000">l</font>ymphoma.
- HER1: Squamous cell [[../Respiratory/Lung cancer|lung cancer]]
- HER2/neu: [[../Reproductive/Breast cancer|Breast cancer]], [[../Reproductive/Ovarian cancer|ovarian cancer]]![[../../assets/img/4b928077f7c2782a9e06547e907a6f0.jpg|4b928077f7c2782a9e06547e907a6f0.jpg]]
- MYC: [[../Endocrine/Neuroblastoma|Neuroblastoma]] (NMYC), small cell [[../Respiratory/Lung cancer|lung cancer]] (LMYC), <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Burkitt lymphoma</span>
- RET: Medullary [[../Endocrine/Thyroid cancer|thyroid cancer]], pheochromocytoma
	- Mutations are associated with [[../Endocrine/Multiple endocrine neoplasias|MEN2]]
- KRAS: Colorectal, lung, pancreatic cancers
	- RAS <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">GTPase</span>
	- EGFR leads to downstream activation of KRAS. 
	- Tumors with KRAS-activating mutations are resistant to anti-EGFR agents as they have a constitutive activation of a downstream signal that is independent of EGFR stimulation or blockade.
# Anti-oncogenes (tumor suppressors)
- APC/β catenin: [[../GI/Colorectal cancer|Colorectal cancer]], [[../GI/Pancreatic cancer|pancreatic cancer]]
- BRCA1, BRCA2: [[../Reproductive/Breast cancer|Breast cancer]], [[../Reproductive/Ovarian cancer|ovarian cancer]]
	- Involved in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">repair of double-stranded DNA breaks</span>
- NF1: [[../Endocrine/Neuroblastoma|Neuroblastoma]], sarcoma
- RB (RB1): Retinoblastoma, osteosarcoma
	- Retinoblastoma protein (Rb protein):<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> causes cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase by inhibiting E2F transcription factor.</span>
	- Needs to be phosphorylated (rendering it inactive) to allow progression through the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">G1/S checkpoint</span>
- TP53: Most cancers, [[./Li-Fraumeni syndrome|Li-Fraumeni (SBLA) syndrome]] (multiple malignancies at early age; Sarcoma, Breast/Brain, Lung/Leukemia, Adrenal gland)
	- Encodes the p53 protein that suppresses cell division and regulates DNA repair and apoptosis.
- VHL: Renal cell cancer
- WT1: [[../Renal/Nephroblastoma|Wilms tumor]]
