# Etiology
## Risk factors for cutaneous melanoma
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">UV radiation exposure</span>
- Light skin types
- Genetic mutations, including:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">BRAF gene mutations</span>
		- Seen in 50% of melanomas 
		- V600E mutation (most common): an activating mutation in the BRAF gene that substitutes glutamic acid for valine at amino acid position 600 
	- CDKN2A gene mutations

# Clinical features
## ABCDE criteria
- A = Asymmetry
- B = Border (irregular border with indistinct margins)
- C = Color (variegated pigmentation within the same lesion)
	- Red areas are due to vessel ectasia (dilation) and local inflammation.
	- Brown or black, flared areas along the border are due to advancing, neoplastic melanocytes.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">White and gray</span> areas appear when cytotoxic T lymphocytes recognize tumor antigens (eg, melan-A) and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">induce apoptosis, leading to malignant melanocyte regression</span> (cleared patches).
- D = Diameter > 6 mm
- E = Evolving (a lesion that changes in size, shape, or color over time)

# Diagnostics
- Histopathology revealed <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">poorly differentiated cells with abundant mitotic activity and necrosis. </span>
- Immunostaining was positive for <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">S-100</span> (a protein expressed in cells derived from the neural crest such as melanocytes) and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">HMB-45</span> (a marker for immature melanosomes found in melanocytic tumors) indicating melanoma.
	- S-100 is also expressed in [[../Neurology/Acoustic neuroma|Schwannoma]]
