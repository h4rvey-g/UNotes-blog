# Epidemiology
- Most commonly affects individuals from the Mediterranean region to eastern Asia, with the highest prevalence observed in Turkey and Japan

---
# Etiology
- Possible autoimmune and infectious triggers (e.g., precipitating HSV or parvovirus infection)
- Strong HLA-B51 association

---
# Pathophysiology
- Autoimmune systemic <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">vasculitis that can involve arteries and veins of all sizes</span>
- Characterized by the deposition of immune complexes, proliferation of CD4+ T cells, and increased cytokines

# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Recurrent painful oral aphthous ulcers (95–100%)</span>
	- Typically the initial presenting symptom
	- Usually last about 1–4 weeks
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Recurrent genital ulcerations (60–90%)</span>
- Ocular disease (50–80%) 
	- Uveitis (iridocyclitis, chorioretinitis), keratitis, and/or retinal vasculitis
- Skin lesions (35–85%)
	- [[./Erythema nodosum|Erythema nodosum]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Positive pathergy skin test</span>: the appearance of an erythematous papule or pustule 48 hours after a 5 mm skin prick with a 20-gauge needle (usually on the forearm)
		- The main reason is subcutaneous vasculitis and high sensitivity reaction of the skin.
- Arthritis (30–70%)
