# Epidemiology

# Etiology
---
## Routes of infection
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hematogenous spread from a distant focus (e.g., skin and soft tissue infection, urinary tract infection)</span>
- Direct inoculation (e.g., during spinal surgery or due to trauma)
- Contiguous spread from adjacent infections (e.g., aorta, esophagus)
## Pathogens
- Common
	- [[../Infective disease/Staphylococcus aureus|Staphylococcus aureus]] (most common, accounting for > 40% of cases)
	- Escherichia coli (second most common)
## Risk factors
- Age > 50 years 
- [[../Blood/Sickle cell disease|Sickle cell disease]] 
- Immunocompromise: e.g., steroid use, [[../Infective disease/Human immunodeficiency virus|HIV]] infection
- Intravenous drug use
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Recent bacteremia</span>
- [[../Cardiology/Infective endocarditis|Infective endocarditis]]
- Recent spinal surgery and instrumentation
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Intravascular devices</span>
- Malnutrition
- Chronic medical conditions:
