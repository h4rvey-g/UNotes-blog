# Epidemiology

# Etiology
## Risk factors
- Increased uric acid production
	- Dietary sources
	- Purine-rich foods (eg, seafood, red meat)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fructose-containing & alcoholic beverages (particularly beer)</span>
	- ↑ Cell turnover (eg, [[../Renal/Tumor lysis syndrome|tumor lysis syndrome]])
	- [[../Biochemistry/Lesch-Nyhan syndrome|Lesch-Nyhan syndrome]] (deficiency of HGPRT)
	- ↑ Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate activity
- Decreased uric acid clearance
	- [[../Renal/Chronic kidney disease|Chronic kidney disease]]
	- Volume depletion
	- [[../Pharmacology/Diuretics|Diuretics]] (eg, thiazide)
	- Cyclosporine & [[../Immunology/Immunosuppressants|tacrolimus]]
- Rapid decline in uric acid levels
	- Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (eg, allopurinol)
	- Uricosuric drugs (eg, probenecid)

# Pathophysiology
- Gout
	- An inflammatory crystal arthropathy that is caused by the precipitation and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">deposition of uric acid crystals in synovial fluid and tissues.</span>
	- It is typically associated with hyperuricemia, but can also occur if uric acid levels are normal.
- Uric acid
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">An end-product of purine metabolism that is excreted by the kidneys</span>
	- Has somewhat <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">poor water solubility</span>
	- Predisposes to gout
- Triggers of urate crystal deposition
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Uric acid levels (due to insufficient excretion or increased production of purines)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Acidosis</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Low temperature (e.g., cool peripheral joints)</span>
- Crystalline arthritis: supersaturation of uric acid in extracellular fluid → intraarticular uric crystal precipitation (coated by IgGs) → phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear cells → release of inflammatory mediators and enzymes → local joint inflammation
- Chronic effects: repeated attacks → aggregations of urate crystals and giant cells (tophi) → deformities and arthritis

# Clinical features
- Most common manifestation
	- Acute severe pain with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">overlying erythema, decreased range of motion, swelling, warmth</span>
	- Possibly fever
	- Symptoms are more likely to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">occur at night, typically waking the patient.</span>
	- Symptoms peak after 12–24 hours and regress over days to weeks. 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Desquamation</span> of the skin overlying the joint may be seen during the recovery from an acute gout flare.
- Location
	- Usually monoarthritis during first attacks
		- In < 20% of cases, patients present with polyarthritis during first attacks. 
		- Asymmetrical distribution is common if more than one joint is affected

>[!tip] 
>- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Pharmacology/Non-opioid analgesics|NSAIDs]] (e.g., naproxen, indomethacin) preferred</span> if no contraindications
>- Colchicine used as second-line therapy
## Acute gout flare
### [[../Pharmacology/Non-opioid analgesics|NSAIDs]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Naproxen</span> or an alternative (e.g., indomethacin, ibuprofen)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Contraindicated in [[../GI/Peptic ulcer disease|PUD]]</span>
### Colchicine  
- Mechanism of action: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">binds and stabilizes tubulin subunits → inhibits microtubule polymerization → inhibits phagocytosis of urate crystals, neutrophil activation, migration, and degranulation </span>
- Adverse effects
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Gastrointestinal symptoms, e.g., diarrhea</span>, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, are the most common.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Renal/Rhabdomyolysis and crush syndrome|Rhabdomyolysis]]</span> , myopathy
	- [[../Neurology/Polyneuropathy|Polyneuropathy]]  
	- Cardiac toxicity, arrhythmias
	- Nephrotoxicity
	- Myelosuppression
	- CNS symptoms (e.g., fatigue, headache)

>[!tip] 
>Colchicine is unlikely to be effective when initiated > 24–36 hours after symptom onset. Colchicine is preferable in patients who cannot tolerate [[../Pharmacology/Non-opioid analgesics|NSAIDs]] or systemic glucocorticoids (e.g., patients with [[../GI/Peptic ulcer disease|PUD]])
## Chronic gout
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Urate-lowering therapy (ULT)</span> is recommended for chronic gout.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">First-line: xanthine-oxidase inhibitors (allopurinol)</span>
	- Second-line: uricosurics (probenecid)
	- Third-line: recombinant uricase (pegloticase, rasburicase)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Also used in [[../Renal/Tumor lysis syndrome|Tumor lysis syndrome]]</span>
- Administer anti-inflammatory prophylaxis before initiating ULT as ULT may trigger, prolong, or worsen an acute gout flare. 
	- Lowering of serum urate levels likely causes preexisting urate crystal deposits to dissolve and become mobile.
### Uricosurics
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Probenecid</span>
- Mechanism of action
	- Inhibition of uric acid reabsorption along renal proximal convoluted tubules  → increased renal elimination
- Side effects
	- [[../Renal/Nephrolithiasis# Uric acid stones|Nephrolithiasis >  Uric acid stones]]
	- Hypersensitivity reactions (sulfa allergy due to being a sulfonamide derivative)
