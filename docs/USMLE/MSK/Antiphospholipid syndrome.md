Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disease associated with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased risk of thrombosis due to the presence of procoagulatory antibodies.</span>
# Etiology
- Primary
	- Idiopathic
- Secondary
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Immunology/Systemic lupus erythematosus|Systemic lupus erythematosus]] (most common cause of secondary APS)</span>
	- [[./Rheumatoid arthritis|Rheumatoid arthritis]]
	- Neoplasms
# Pathophysiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Formation of procoagulatory antiphospholipid antibodies </span>
	- In most cases, the antibodies are formed secondary to autoimmune diseases or infections (see “Etiology” above).
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Antibodies form complexes with anticoagulant proteins, thereby inactivating them (e.g., [[../Blood/Inhibition of hemostasis|protein C]], protein S, antithrombin III).</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Antibodies activate platelets and vascular endothelium, leading to increased binding of platelets</span>
- Induction of a hypercoagulable state → ↑ risk of thrombosis and embolism
# Clinical features
APS usually manifests with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">recurring thrombotic events that may affect any organ.</span>
- Venous
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Deep vein thrombosis </span>
		- There is diffuse edema and erythema of the right leg and foot. The diameter of the right calf is visibly greater than that of the left.![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231216111912.png|Pasted image 20231216111912.png]]
	- [[../Respiratory/Pulmonary embolism|Pulmonary embolism]]
	- Livedo reticularis 
		- Blood clots in capillaries lead to swelling of venules, resulting in a purplish, net-like discoloration of the skin.
	- Ulceration
- Arterial
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Stroke, transient ischemic attacks</span>
	- Occlusion of organ arteries (e.g., myocardial infarction)
	- Occlusion of distal extremity arteries (ischemia and gangrene)
- Capillaries: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">splinter hemorrhages</span> 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Reproductive/Pregnancy|Pregnancy]]-related: recurrent miscarriages and premature births </span>
	- Caused by thrombosis of placental vessels and possible subsequent placental infarction
# Diagnose
>[!tip] 
>Thrombosis in APS is typically unprovoked (e.g., unprovoked DVT), recurrent, and/or manifests in unusual sites (e.g., kidneys, liver, retina). It is most commonly seen in younger individuals (< 50 years of age) and in individuals with comorbid autoimmune diseases (e.g., [[../Immunology/Systemic lupus erythematosus|SLE]]).
- Coagulation panel: prolonged aPTT (caused by lupus anticoagulant)
## Antiphospholipid antibodies
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lupus anticoagulant (LA)</span>: antibodies against certain phospholipids in cellular membranes; detection involves a three-step procedure
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">These antibodies inhibit coagulation and therefore prolong aPTT in vitro, but have a procoagulatory effect in vivo.</span>
	1. Screening for phospholipid-dependent coagulation with either:
		- Prolonged aPTT
		- Prolonged dilute Russell viper venom time (dRVVT)
	2. Mixing study: The patient's plasma is mixed with normal plasma (which contains clotting factors).
		- aPTT or dRVVT normalize: Presence of lupus anticoagulant ruled out; prolonged aPTT may be due to a lack of clotting factors.
		- aPTT or dRVVT remain prolonged: Lupus anticoagulant may be present.
	3. Confirmation of phospholipid dependence: Phospholipid is added.
		- aPTT or dRVVT normalize: Presence of lupus [[../Blood/Anticoagulants|anticoagulants]] is confirmed.
		- aPTT or dRVVT remain prolonged: Consider a factor deficiency.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anticardiolipin antibodies (IgG and IgM)</span>: antibodies against cardiolipin, a phospholipid in cellular membranes 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anti-β2-glycoprotein antibodies (IgG and IgM)</span>: antibodies directed against the cardiolipin ­binding factor β2­ glycoprotein I that have prothrombotic effects
