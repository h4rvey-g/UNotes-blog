# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- Idiopathic inflammatory autoimmune disorder of unknown etiology
- Risk factors include:
	- Genetic disposition: associated with [[../Immunology/HLA system|HLA-DR4]] and HLA-DR1
	- Environmental factors (e.g., smoking)
	- Hormonal factors (premenopausal women are at the highest risk, suggesting a predisposing role of female sex hormones)

---
# Pathophysiology
- Bouts of inflammation, angiogenesis, and proliferation → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">proliferative granulation tissue with mononuclear inflammatory cells → pannus and synovial hypertrophy → invasion, progressive destruction, and deterioration of cartilage and bone</span>
- Antibodies against Fc portion of IgG (rheumatoid factor, RF) are produced to aid in removing autoantibodies and immune complexes.
	- RF excess triggers formation of new immune complexes and [[../Immunology/Type III hypersensitivity reactions|type III HSR]]
	- Individuals with positive RF are more likely to develop extraarticular manifestations.

# Clinical features
![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240221152545.png|Pasted image 20240221152545.png]]
## Extraarticular manifestations
- Rheumatoid nodules
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Skin</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Nontender, firm, subcutaneous swellings</span> (2 mm–5 cm) 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Commonly occur in areas exposed to higher pressure, e.g., extensor side of the forearm, bony prominences</span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240227143305.png|Pasted image 20240227143305.png]]
	- Lungs
		- Typically bilateral and peripheral
		- Rheumatoid pulmonary nodules may be accompanied by fibrosis and pneumoconiosis (Caplan syndrome).

# Diagnostics
![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240116151535.png|Pasted image 20240116151535.png]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anticitrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA), e.g., anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) </span>
	- Tissue inflammation causes arginine residues in proteins such as vimentin to be enzymatically converted into citrulline through a process called citrullination.  This alters the shape of the proteins, which can then serve as neoantigens that generate an immune response.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Rheumatoid factor (RF): IgM autoantibodies against the Fc region of IgG antibodies</span>
# Differential diagnostics
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Parvovirus B19 will presents with similar symptoms, except for rash, normal ESR, and acute onset</span>
- See [[./Osteoarthritis#Differential diagnosis|Osteoarthritis > Differential diagnosis]]

# Treatment
## Acute anti-inflammatory treatment
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Glucocorticoids</span>
	- Systemic prednisone
		- Longer-term therapy: Only use in patients with highly active RA
- [[../Pharmacology/Non-opioid analgesics|NSAIDs]] and selective COX-2 inhibitors: relieve symptoms, but do not improve the prognosis
## Long-term pharmacological treatment
### Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Methotrexate (MTX): first-line treatment in patients with moderate to high disease activity</span>
	- To minimize adverse effects, administer folic acid.
#### Biologic DMARDs
- Indication: persistent moderate or severe disease activity after 3 months of conventional DMARD therapy 
- Agents
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">TNF-α inhibitors</span>: e.g., adalimumab, infliximab, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">etanercept</span>
		- a receptor molecule (cept)
