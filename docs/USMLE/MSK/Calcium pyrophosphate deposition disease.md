# Epidemiology
- Age of onset: adults > 60 years

---
# Etiology
- The primary (idiopathic) form is most common, with age as a major risk factor.
- Secondary forms
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Joint trauma/damage: including joint surgery, previous juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and [[./Osteoarthritis|Osteoarthritis]]</span>
	- Metabolic disorders: including [[../Endocrine/Hyperparathyroidism|hyperparathyroidism]], [[../Blood/Hemochromatosis|hemochromatosis]], hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatasia, and possibly [[./Gout|gout]]
	- Familial chondrocalcinosis: due to mutations in the CCAL1 or CCAL2 genes

# Pathophysiology
Deposition of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPP or CPPD) crystals in articular cartilage → paroxysmal joint inflammation and cartilage destruction → inflammatory arthritis (crystalline arthritis)

---
# Clinical features
## Acute CPP crystal arthritis (pseudogout)
- Clinical features
	- Acute attack of pain and swelling in the affected joint(s)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Monoarthritis</span> (occasionally oligoarthritis)
	- Most commonly affects the knee and wrist; can also affect other large joints (e.g., hips, ankles)
	- Typically self-limited
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Features that differ from acute [[./Gout|gout]]</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Longer duration of acute attacks </span>
		- Up to several months
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Possible systemic symptoms</span>
		- E.g., fever, chills, altered mental status in the elderly
## Chronic CPP crystal arthritis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[./Osteoarthritis|Osteoarthritis]]-like presentation ([[./Osteoarthritis|osteoarthritis]] with CPPD; pseudo-[[./Osteoarthritis|osteoarthritis]])</span>
	- Most common form of CPPD disease
	- Characterized by progressive joint degeneration
		- Usually polyarticular; can occur in joints not typically affected by [[./Osteoarthritis|OA]] 
		- More severe than typical [[./Osteoarthritis|OA]]
		- Often associated with pseudogout-like flares of acute inflammatory arthritis

# Diagnostics
## [[./Arthrocentesis|Arthrocentesis]] and synovial fluid analysis (SFA)
- Cloudy fluid
- Polarized light microscopy (with a red filter) appearance of CPP crystals
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Rhomboid-shaped crystals that are weakly positively birefringent</span>
	- Crystals appear blue when their optical axis is oriented parallel to the polarizer.
	- Crystals appear yellow when their axis is perpendicular to the polarizer. 
- Cell count: WBC > 2000/μL with > 50% neutrophils
## Imaging
- X-ray of the affected joint(s)
	- Chondrocalcinosis: calcification of cartilage in the affected joints
