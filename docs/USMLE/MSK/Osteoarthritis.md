# Treatment
## Approach
Follow a stepwise approach to treatment: Start with nonpharmacological management, followed by pharmacological and/or surgical treatment if needed.
- Nonpharmacological management: e.g., <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">exercise and weight loss</span>
- Pharmacotherapy
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">First line: e.g., topical or oral NSAIDs</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Second line: e.g., [[../Pharmacology/Non-opioid analgesics|acetaminophen]] or intraarticular glucocorticoid injections</span>
- Surgical management: e.g., complete or partial joint replacement (arthroplasty) using an endoprosthesis

>Pharmacotherapy should only be used as a short-term treatment in symptomatic patients; long-term therapy is associated with many adverse effects.
