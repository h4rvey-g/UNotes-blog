- Commonly affects young men

# Clinical features
>[!tip] 
><span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The clinical manifestations are caused by immune complexes involving bacterial antigens.  However, it does not represent disseminated infection, and joint aspirates are sterile (ie, it is a 'reactive' not infectious arthritis).</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Recent [[../Renal/Urinary tract infections|UTI]] or GI infections</span>
- Musculoskeletal symptoms
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Oligoarthritis (sometimes polyarthritis)</span>
		- Acute onset
		- Often asymmetrical with a migratory character
		- Occurs predominantly in the lower extremities 
	- Sacroiliitis
	- Enthesitis
	- Dactylitis
- Extra‑articular symptoms
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Conjunctivitis</span>, iritis, episcleritis, or keratitis 
	- Dermatologic manifestations
	- Balanitis circinata: skin lesions of the glans resembling [[./Psoriasis|psoriasis]] 
	- Keratoderma blenorrhagicum: hyperkeratinization of the palms and soles 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Renal/Urethritis|Urethritis]]</span>
- Symptoms from preceding infection 
	- [[../GI/Diarrhea|Diarrhea]]
	- Urogenital tract symptoms (dysuria, pelvic pain, prostatitis)

>[!Mnemonic] 
>Classic triad of reactive arthritis (seen in approximately one-third of affected individuals): “can't see (conjunctivitis), can't pee ([[../Renal/Urethritis|urethritis]]), can't climb a tree (arthritis)”.
