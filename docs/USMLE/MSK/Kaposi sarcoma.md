# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- Caused by human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8), a large DNA gamma herpes virus
- Routes of transmission include
	- Saliva
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sexual contact</span>
	- Potentially via blood [[../Blood/Transfusion|transfusion]] and IV drug use

# Clinical features
Patients typically present with multiple cutaneous or visceral elevated tumors with rapid growth.
- Most commonly affects the skin but may also involve the lymph nodes, mucosa, and viscera
- Can occur at any CD4 count (typically < 500/mm3)
- Initial stage: 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Painless, nonpruritic, violet papules or nodules on skin and mucosa (especially face/oral cavity and chest) </span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231028161117.png|Pasted image 20231028161117.png]]
	- Solitary, darkly pigmented plaques, which can evolve into nodular, bluish, submucosal, and painful skin changes
	- Lesions resemble those of bacillary angiomatosis.
- Progression: may disseminate to the organs, particularly the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, and lymph nodes.
	- Gastrointestinal tract involvement: abdominal pain and [[../GI/Diarrhea|diarrhea]]; hemorrhage and bowel obstruction in severe cases 
	- Pulmonary involvement: Lesions cause dyspnea, cough, and/or hemoptysis.

# Diagnostics
- Biopsy and histology of cutaneous or visceral lesions (indicated in all patients)
	- Spindle shaped cells, leukocyte infiltration, and angiogenesis![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231028161734.png|Pasted image 20231028161734.png]]
