# Definition
- Dermatomyositis (DM): an inflammatory myopathy characterized by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">progressive symmetrical proximal muscle weakness and distinctive skin findings</span>
- Polymyositis (PM): an inflammatory myopathy <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">affecting the proximal skeletal muscles</span>, with evidence of elevated CK and myositis on EMG and biopsy in the absence of any of the characteristic findings of the other IIM (a rare diagnosis of exclusion)

# Etiology
- Polymyositis (PM): <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">cell-mediated cytotoxicity</span> against unidentified skeletal muscle antigens, chiefly affecting the endomysium
- Dermatomyositis (DM): idiopathic or paraneoplastic <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">antibody-mediated </span>vasculopathy, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">associated with malignancies ([[../Blood/Non-Hodgkin lymphomas|non-Hodgkin lymphoma]]; lung, stomach, colorectal, or [[../Reproductive/Ovarian cancer|ovarian cancer]] )</span>
	- may occur alone or as a paraneoplastic syndrome of an underlying malignancy, most commonly due to underlying adenocarcinoma (eg, ovary, lung, pancreas).

# Diagnostics
- ↑ CK
- Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs)
- Myositis-specific antibodies
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anti-Jo-1 antibodies</span> (anti–histidyl-<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">tRNA</span> synthetase)![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240116151535.png|Pasted image 20240116151535.png]]
- Muscle biopsy: Gold standard for diagnosis of IIM
	- Typical findings
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Muscle fiber damage</span>
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Necrosis</span>, degeneration, and regeneration
		- Inflammatory cellular infiltrates
