# Etiology
## Primary osteoporosis (most common)
- Type I (postmenopausal osteoporosis): postmenopausal women 
	- [[../Reproductive/Androgen and estrogen synthesis|Estrogen]] stimulates [[./Bone remodeling|osteoblasts]] and inhibits [[./Bone remodeling|osteoclasts]].
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The decreased estrogen levels following [[../Reproductive/Menopause|menopause]] lead to increased bone resorption.</span>
- Type II (senile osteoporosis): gradual loss of bone mass as patients age (especially > 70 years)
## Secondary osteoporosis
- Most commonly due to systemic <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">long-term therapy with corticosteroids</span> (e.g., in patients with autoimmune disease)
- Endocrine/metabolic: [[../Endocrine/Cushing syndrome|hypercortisolism]], hypogonadism, [[../Endocrine/Hyperthyroidism|hyperthyroidism]], [[../Endocrine/Hyperparathyroidism|hyperparathyroidism]], renal disease
## Additional risk factors
- Cigarette smoking
- Immobilization or inadequate physical activity
- [[../GI/Malabsorption|Malabsorption]] (e.g., [[../GI/Celiac disease|celiac disease]]), malnutrition (e.g., diet low in calcium and vitamin D), anorexia

## Nonbisphosphonates
### PTH and [[../Renal/Parathyroid hormone-related protein|PTH-related protein]] analogues
- Teriparatide, Abaloparatide
- Recombinant human parathyroid hormone that increases osteoblastic activity → increased bone growth
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pulsatile PTH secretion has an anabolic effect on bone metabolism, stimulating osteoblast proliferation, decreasing osteoblast apoptosis, and inducing increased formation of new bone.</span>  Recombinant PTH analogues (eg, teriparatide) are used to treat severe osteoporosis; these analogues promote [[./Bone remodeling|bone remodeling]] by inducing increased resorption of old bone while stimulating a corresponding increase in new bone production, resulting in a net increase in total bone mass (ie, positive bone balance).
