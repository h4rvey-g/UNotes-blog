# Epidemiology
---


# Etiology
---
- Cumulative UV exposure (from the sun or from tanning beds) is the most significant risk factor

# Pathophysiology
---


# Clinical features
---
- Precursor and early lesions
	- Precursor lesions (actinic keratosis) and in situ lesions (Bowen disease) typically manifest as a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">enlarging, rounded nodule with rough (keratinized) surface Â± ulceration, crusting and bleeding
	- Commonly on sun-exposed skin</span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240412214818.png|Pasted image 20240412214818.png]]
- Invasive cSCC
	- Easy friability (i.e., <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">bleeds easily</span> after minor trauma)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Central ulceration</span>
	- Typically occurs on sun-exposed areas
- Metastatic cSCC
	- Most common sites for metastasis include lymph nodes (80%)

# Diagnostics

## Pathology
cSCC occurs as a result of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">malignant transformation of keratinocytes in the [[./Skin layers|stratum spinosum]] (prickle cell layer) of the epidermis.</span> These atypical keratinocytes appear as enlarged, polygonal cells with nuclear pleomorphism and atypical mitoses.
- Sheets or nests of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">malignant keratinocytes</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Keratinization (eg, keratin pearls) & intercellular bridges</span>![[../../assets/img/L80129.png|L80129.png]]

# Differential diagnostics
---
- Nodular [[./Basal cell carcinoma|BCC]] classically has a translucent or pearly appearance, often with central telangiectasias.![[../../assets/img/L34111.png|L34111.png]]
- Cutaneous SCC classically has a rough or scaly (keratinized) surface![[../../assets/img/L20488.png|L20488.png]]
