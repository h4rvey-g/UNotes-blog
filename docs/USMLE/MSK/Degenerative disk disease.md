### Provocative maneuvers for lumbosacral radiculopathy
Leg raising maneuvers are used to screen for lumbosacral radiculopathy![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240328144614.png|Pasted image 20240328144614.png]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Straight leg raise test (Lasegue sign): A straight leg raise leads to increased pain in the ipsilateral leg with radiation to the motor or sensory area of the affected nerve root. </span>
	- Pseudo-Lasègue sign (bottom): A straight leg raise produces an aching pain <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">along the back of the leg (rather than typical radicular pain). This indicates that the pain likely originates from the hamstring muscles</span> (usually occurs with the leg flexed to > 60º).
- Bragard sign: A straight leg raise leads to increased pain in the ipsilateral leg; lowering the leg to just below the level where pain is produced and pulling the foot to dorsiflexion reproduces the pain.
- Crossed straight leg raise test: A crossed straight leg raise leads to pain in the ipsilateral leg radiating to the motor and sensory area of the affected nerve root. 
- Reverse straight leg raise test: A reverse straight leg raise leads to pain in the ipsilateral leg radiating to the motor and sensory area of the affected nerve root.

## Conservative management
- For patients with severe pain, consider periradicular therapy: image-guided injection of local anesthetic (e.g., ropivacaine) and glucocorticoids at the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">intervertebral foramen</span> to reduce inflammation and edema at the affected nerve root
