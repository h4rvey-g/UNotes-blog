# Bone remodeling in cortical bone

## Degradation
- Osteoclasts organize in a basic multicellular unit (BMU) and excavate a tunnel in the cortical bone. 
- Connective tissue vessels and unmyelinated nerves grow in the tunnel.
## Formation
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Osteoclasts are followed by osteoblasts → deposition of the first osteoid layer in the tunnel</span>
- Additional osteoblasts follow and deposit osteoid onto the first osteoid layer → osteoblasts of the first layer are walled in → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">osteoblasts become osteocytes</span>
	- Osteocyte function relies on the presence of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">gap junctions</span> that connect the cytoplasmic processes between osteocytes.  These junctions facilitate cell-to-cell communication, allowing intracellular signals (eg, calcium, cyclic AMP) to propagate to neighboring cells.
- The deposition process is repeated until the tunnel is almost full → central Haversian canal remains open
- The innermost (i.e., last) generation of osteoblasts is no longer walled in → cells return to their resting state and form the endosteum
## Mineralization: occurs successively
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Osteoblasts secrete [[../Biochemistry/Collagen|collagen]] and vesicles into the extracellular matrix.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Vesicles contain enzymes (e.g., [[../Blood/Alkaline phosphatase|alkaline phosphatase]]), which increase local phosphate levels (e.g., by cleavage of pyrophosphate).</span>
- Calcium-binding molecules in the vesicles most likely serve as a focal point.
- Initial formation of hydroxyapatite crystals around the focal point in the vesicles
- Independent growth of the crystals until penetration of the vesicle membrane
- Release of crystals in the extracellular matrix
- Growth of crystals in the extracellular matrix and accumulation of [[../Biochemistry/Collagen|collagen]] fibrils
# Regulation of bone remodeling
- RANK (receptor activator of nuclear factor κB): receptor on osteoclasts and osteoclast precursors, for interaction with osteoblasts
- RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Membrane-bound protein of osteoblasts that stimulates osteoclasts by interacting with RANK</span>
	- Ensures fusion and differentiation into activated osteoclasts and prevents their apoptosis
- Hormones
	- PTH effects
		- At low levels: increased bone formation and increased apoptosis of osteoclasts → decreased bone resorption (anabolic effects)
		- At high levels (e.g., primary [[../Endocrine/Hyperparathyroidism|hyperparathyroidism]]): activation of osteoclasts → increased bone resorption (catabolic effects) → [[./Osteoporosis|osteoporosis]] or osteitis fibrosa cystica
	- [[../Reproductive/Androgen and estrogen synthesis|Estrogen]] effects
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Inhibits apoptosis of osteoblasts, leading to increased bone formation</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Stimulates apoptosis of osteoclasts, leading to decreased bone resorption</span>
		- Stimulates closure of the epiphyseal plate in puberty
		- [[../Reproductive/Androgen and estrogen synthesis|Estrogen]] deficiency (e.g., postmenopausal or after bilateral oophorectomy) leads to increased bone resorption, which can result in [[./Osteoporosis|osteoporosis]].
	- Thyroid hormone
		- In <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">long-standing hyperthyroidism</span>, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[./Osteoporosis|osteoporosis]]</span> due to the direct effect of T3 on osteoclastic bone resorption, fractures (in the elderly)
