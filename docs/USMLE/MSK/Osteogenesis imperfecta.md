A genetic disorder characterized by impaired osteogenesis that results in skeletal deformities and brittle bones that fracture easily
# Epidemiology
- Various genetic defects; <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">most commonly autosomal dominant mutations</span> in COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes

# Clinical features
## Osteogenesis imperfecta type I (the mildest and most common form)
- Growth delay
- Skeletal deformities, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">brittle bones</span>
- Bowing of bones and saber shins ![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230929144728.png|Pasted image 20230929144728.png]]
- Fractures during childbirth  and recurrently from minimal trauma thereafter
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Blue sclerae</span> (choroidal veins show through the thin, translucent sclera) ![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230929144322.png|Pasted image 20230929144322.png]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Progressive [[../Neurology/Hearing loss|hearing loss]]</span> due to deformation, fracture, and/or atrophy of the ossicles
- Brittle, opalescent teeth
## Osteogenesis imperfecta type II
- Most severe form; usually fatal within the first year of life
- Multiple intrauterine and/or perinatal fractures
- Micromelia, hypoplastic thorax
- Underdeveloped lungs leading to respiratory problems
