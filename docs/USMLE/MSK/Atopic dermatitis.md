# Epidemiology
- Onset of symptoms usually occurs at 3–6 months of age. 
- Disease often improves with age.

# Pathophysiology
The pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis involves immune dysregulation and genetically mediated skin barrier dysfunction (eg, filaggrin mutation).  The epidermal dysfunction increases cutaneous exposure to environmental allergens, which induce a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Th2-predominant immune response</span>.  Key Th2 cytokines that trigger acute inflammation in atopic dermatitis are <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">IL-4 and IL-13</span>, and mechanisms include the following:
- Stimulation of plasma cell <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">IgE production</span>, which facilitates allergen sensitization and inflammation
- Suppressed expression of epidermal barrier components, which enhances [[../Infective disease/Staphylococcus aureus|Staphylococcus aureus]] colonization and inflammation
- Inhibition of Th1-type immune response and antimicrobial peptide production, which facilitate secondary microbial infections that complicate atopic dermatitis

>[!tip] 
>The symptoms of atopic dermatitis are variable and often change in the course of a lifetime. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pruritus and dry skin are usually the main symptoms.</span>
><span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most patients have a history of other atopic disorders</span>

- Infantile AD (age < 2 years)
	- Eczema involving the face, head, and extensor surfaces of the extremities that usually spares the diaper area 
	- May present initially with features similar to seborrheic dermatitis, e.g., cradle cap
	- **Dennie-Morgan fold**: increased folds below the eye 
		- as a result of eyelid dermatitis![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230729153839.png|Pasted image 20230729153839.png]]
	- Occasionally, lesions appear on the trunk. 
- Childhood AD (age 2–12 years)
	- Eczema: <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">flexural creases</mark> (antecubital fossa and popliteal fossa), skin folds, extensor surface of hands 
	- Lesions usually become lichenified (thickening of the skin with accentuated skin markings).
	- ![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230729155030.png|Pasted image 20230729155030.png]]
- Adult/adolescent AD (age > 12 years)
	- Lichenified lesions and pruritus of <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">flexor surfaces</mark> of the extremities 
	- Antecubital fossae are frequently involved. 
	- Adult AD may also present as nummular eczema.
- Associated skin findings in AD
	- Atopic triad: a triad of [[../Respiratory/Asthma|asthma]], allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis that is linked to allergen-triggered IgE-mast cell activation
	- Food allergies
	- Keratosis pilaris: keratinized hair follicles (rough bumps) typically distributed over extensor arms and thighs
	- Hertoghe sign: thinning or loss of the outer third of the eyebrows

# Diagnostics
- [[../Respiratory/Atopy|Atopy]]
	- Personal and/or family history
	- Immunoglobulin E reactivity (↑ serum IgE) 
	- Comorbid atopic diseases (i.e., [[../Respiratory/Asthma|asthma]], allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and food allergies)

---
# Treatment
- Topical steroids (preferred)
- Topical [[../Immunology/Immunosuppressants|calcineurin inhibitors]]
