- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Spasticity** = Hyperreflexia = Clonus.</span> All are the same for test purposes, though there are some subtle technical differences. Think of it as a degree of magnitude along the +1 to +4 scale of reflex testing. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">This could make you think UMN lesions, hypocalcemia, [[../Neurology/Serotonin syndrome|serotonin syndrome]], etc.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Rigidity** is more closely associated with specific pathologies like Parkinson's, acute dystonia, and [[../Psychiatry/Neuroleptic malignant syndrome|neuroleptic malignant syndrome]]. Unlike spasticity, it's not along the spectrum of reflex testing -- just kind of it's own thing.</span> I believe it's accurate to think of it as a distinct sign of higher-pathway neurological pathology, as you can tell by the dopaminergic pathways involved in my examples.
