# Epidemiology

# Etiology
---
## Causes
- Hormonal factors
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Androgens</span> during puberty → increased production of sebum by sebaceous glands
	- In women: menstrual cycle 
		- Acne usually worsens the week before menstruation begins. The increase of progesterone can make the skin secrete more oil.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Follicular hyperkeratosis</span>: Higher keratinocyte activity and decreased keratinocyte shedding in pilosebaceous units leads to the formation of comedones.
- Bacterial colonization with Cutibacterium acnes (formerly known as Propionibacterium acnes) → inflammatory reactions with formation of papules, nodules, pustules, and/or cysts
## Risk factors
- Increased circulating androgens (eg, puberty, [[../Reproductive/Polycystic ovary syndrome|polycystic ovary syndrome]])
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Mechanical trauma/friction (eg, excessive scrubbing, tight clothing)</span>
- Comedogenic oil-based skin & hair products

# Pathophysiology

![[../../assets/img/highresdefault_L47302.jpg|highresdefault_L47302.jpg]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hyperkeratinization</span> due to abnormal epithelial growth and differentiation of corneocytes leads to keratin plug formation in the pilosebaceous follicles.  These blocked follicles are referred to as comedones (ie, whiteheads and blackheads).
- In response to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Reproductive/Androgen and estrogen synthesis|androgen]] stimulation</span> (eg, during pubertal adrenarche), <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">sebaceous glands</span> enlarge (not involute) and increase production of sebum, a lipid-rich substance that facilitates obstruction of pilosebaceous follicles (Choice A).
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cutibacterium acnes</span>, an anaerobic bacteria that relies on sebum as a nutrient source, proliferates in occluded follicles, triggering an <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">inflammatory</span> response that results in the red papules and pustules characteristic of nodulocystic acne.
# Clinical features
---
- Commonly found in areas with sebaceous glands (predilection sites: face, shoulders, upper chest, and back)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Noninflammatory acne: comedonal acne</span>
	- Open comedones (“blackheads”): dark, open portion of sebaceous material 
	- Closed comedones (“whiteheads”): closed small round lesions that contain whitish material (sebum and shed keratin)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Inflammatory acne: Affected areas are red and can be painful.</span>
	- Papular/pustular acne: papules, pustules that arise from comedones 
	- Nodulocystic acne (> 5 mm in diameter)
	- Commonly affects the back and neck

# Treatment
---
## Topical retinoids  
- Retinoids are [[../Biochemistry/Vitamin A|vitamin A]] derivatives with an anti-inflammatory and comedolytic effect.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increase epithelial mitosis and desquamation, and help extrude debris from comedones, limiting acne formation.</span>
- Used as monotherapy for comedonal acne or adjunctive therapy for acne of any severity
