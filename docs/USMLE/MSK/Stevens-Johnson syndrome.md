# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- Drugs (most common trigger, ∼ 80% of cases) 
	- Antibiotics: sulfonamides (e.g., TMP/SMX), aminopenicillins, rifampicin
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Neurology/Anticonvulsant drugs|Antiepileptics]]: phenytoin, phenobarbital, lamotrigine, valproic acid, carbamazepine, ethosuximide</span>
	- Oxicam [[../Pharmacology/Non-opioid analgesics|NSAIDs]] (e.g., piroxicam)
	- Allopurinol
	- Sulfasalazine
- Risk factors
	- [[../Infective disease/Human immunodeficiency virus|HIV]] infection

# Pathophysiology
The pathogenesis is not completely understood but is thought to involve a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">delayed hypersensitivity reaction (type IV): ↑ activity of drug-specific cytotoxic T cells → release of granulysin (a cytolytic protein) by an unknown mechanism → damage to keratinocytes</span>

# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Prodromal phase (begins 1–3 weeks after the intake of medication): high fever (usually > 39°C or 102°F)</span>, malaise, sore throat, myalgia and/or arthralgia
- Mucocutaneous lesions appear 1–3 days after the onset of prodromal symptoms
	- Cutaneous manifestation sequence
		1. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Painful, erythematous/purpuric macules</span>
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">May have a targetoid appearance</span> (cockade lesions)
			- Typically seen over the face and trunk
		2. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lesions form bullae and/or vesicles; positive Nikolsky sign</span> 
		3. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Extensive, full-thickness epidermal necrosis and sloughing (resembling large superficial burns)</span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240107172005.png|Pasted image 20240107172005.png]]
	- Mucosal membranes: almost always involved
- Shock may develop
>[!tip] 
>The involvement of mucous membranes differentiates SJS from [[./Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome|staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome]] (SSSS) in which mucous membranes are spared!
