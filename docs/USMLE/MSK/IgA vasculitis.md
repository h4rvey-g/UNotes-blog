# Epidemiology
- Sex: ♂ > ♀
- Age: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">more common in children</span>
	- 90% of affected individuals < 10 years
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Other small vessel [[./Vasculitides|vasculitides]] mainly affect adults</span>

# Etiology
- Preceding infection
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Up to 90% of cases are preceded by viral or bacterial infection 1–3 weeks prior.</span>
	- Most commonly an upper respiratory tract infection caused by group A Streptococcus
	- [[../Renal/IgA nephropathy|IgA nephropathy]]
	- Drugs

# Pathophysiology
Hypothesized pathophysiological mechanism: exposure to allergen/antigen (e.g., infection, drugs) → stimulation of IgA production → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">deposition of IgA immune complexes in vascular walls (e.g., in the skin, GI tract, joints, kidneys) → activation of [[../Immunology/Complement system|complement]] → vascular inflammation and damage</span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231029162851.png|Pasted image 20231029162851.png]]

# Clinical features
![[../../assets/img/L41662.jpg|L41662.jpg]]
An upper respiratory tract infection often precedes symptom onset by 1–3 weeks.
- Skin (∼ 100% of cases)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Symmetrically distributed erythematous papules or urticarial lesions that coalesce into palpable purpura</span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231010165500.png|Pasted image 20231010165500.png]]
	- Bullae, pustules, and necrotic or hemorrhagic purpura (more common in adults)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most commonly in the lower extremities, buttocks, and other areas of pressure or constraint (e.g., from clothing)</span>
- Joints (∼ 75% of cases)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Arthritis/arthralgia </span>
		- Usually bilateral, self-limited, and nondestructive; <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">children may present with a limp.</span>
	- Most commonly in the ankles and knees
- Gastrointestinal tract (∼ 60% of cases)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Colicky abdominal pain </span>
	- Intussusception 
	- Hematochezia or melena
	- Nausea and/or vomiting
- Kidneys: IgA nephritis (20–50% of children; 50–80% of adults)
	- [[../Renal/Nephritic syndrome|Nephritic syndrome]]

>[!tip] 
>IgAV is an important differential diagnosis to consider in children with a limp.
