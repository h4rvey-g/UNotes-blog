# Diagnostics
The diagnosis of fibromyalgia is based on symptoms alone. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Imaging studies and biomarkers (e.g., ESR) are typically normal.</span>
- Consider the diagnosis in patients with cardinal symptoms of fibromyalgia (± fibro fog) for ≥ 3 months.
- Order CBC and either ESR or CRP to identify a concomitant inflammatory condition.
