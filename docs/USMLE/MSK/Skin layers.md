- Stratum corneum: outer layer of the epidermis 
	- Consists of dead (anuclear), keratin-filled cells
	- This layer is constantly being sloughed off.
- Stratum lucidum: thin, translucent layer
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Located only on thick skin (palms and soles)</span>
	- Composed of a homogeneous layer of keratinocytes with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">no nuclei or organelles</span>
- Stratum granulosum: also called the granular layer
	- Contains keratohyalin
	- This layer has waterproof properties.
- Stratum spinosum
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Composed of actively dividing keratinocytes with spinous-like projections (prickle cells)</span>
	- This layer <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">produces keratin and induces keratinization</span>.
	- Langerhans cells are also located in this layer.
	- If undergoes malignant changes, will lead to [[./Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma|cSCC]]
- Stratum basale (also called the basal cell layer of the epidermis)
	- Stem cells of the epidermis (their daughter cells migrate upwards and differentiate into other cells)
	- Melanocytes and Merkel cells are also located in this layer.
	- The stratum basale is regenerative (basal keratinocytes proliferate to fill skin defects).
