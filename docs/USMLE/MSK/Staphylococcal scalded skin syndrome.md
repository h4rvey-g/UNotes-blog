# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- Pathogen
	- [[../Infective disease/Staphylococcus aureus|Staphylococcus aureus]] strains that produce exfoliative toxins
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Exfoliative toxin A and B</span> have been shown to cleave desmoglein-1 in the granular layer of the epidermis → disruption of keratinocyte attachments
- Route of infection: dissemination of toxins from a local infection
	- Following a staphylococcal infection elsewhere (e.g., skin, mouth, nose, throat, GI tract, umbilicus). The initial infection may also be completely undetected.
	- Following bullous impetigo
		- Bullous impetigo is also caused by staphylococcal exfoliative toxins but remains localized, in contrast to SSSS.

>[!tip] 
>SSSS belongs to the spectrum of diseases mediated by specific staphylococcal toxins, which also includes bullous impetigo, toxic shock syndrome (TSS), and [[../Infective disease/Staphylococcus aureus|Staphylococcus aureus]] [[../Infective disease/Food poisoning|food poisoning]]. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Unlike TSS, SSSS does not have systemic manifestations (involvement of, e.g., liver, kidney, bone marrow, CNS).</span>

# Pathophysiology

# Clinical features
## Initially
- Fever, malaise, and irritability
- Skin tenderness
- Diffuse or localized erythema, often beginning periorally 
## After 24–48 hours
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Flaccid, easily ruptured blisters that break to reveal moist, red skin beneath (i.e., with a “scalded” appearance) → widespread sloughing of epidermal skin </span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240107171727.png|Pasted image 20240107171727.png]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Nikolsky sign is positive</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">No mucosal involvement</span>
- Cracking, and crusting is common
- Signs of shock (hypotension, tachycardia)

>[!tip] 
><span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[./Stevens-Johnson syndrome|Stevens-Johnson syndrome]] and toxic epidermal necrolysis manifest with mucosal involvement, SSSS does not.</span>
