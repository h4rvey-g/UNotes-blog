# Epidemiology
---


# Etiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Association with [[./Polymyalgia rheumatica|polymyalgia rheumatica]]</span> (PMR): up to 50% of patients with giant cell arteritis also have PMR.

# Pathophysiology
---
- Monocytes differentiate into macrophages and giant cells, which produce cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α) that augment the inflammatory response → focal granulomatous inflammation
- Most commonly involves <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">external carotid artery branches (especially temporal artery)</span>, as well as the aorta and vertebral arteries

# Clinical features
---
- Cranial giant cell arteritis: involves the extracranial branches of the common carotid, internal carotid, and external carotid arteries (the temporal artery is the most commonly affected vessel)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">New-onset unilateral (or bilateral) headache</span>
		- Can be pulse-synchronous, throbbing, dull
		- Typically located <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">over the temples</span>
	- Hardened and tender temporal artery ![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240403193138.png|Pasted image 20240403193138.png]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Jaw claudication: jaw pain when chewing</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Vision loss: due to inflammation and occlusion of the ophthalmic artery and its branches  </span>
		- Scintillating scotoma
		- Amaurosis fugax or permanent loss of vision due to anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Symptoms of [[./Polymyalgia rheumatica|polymyalgia rheumatica]], e.g. muscle pain primarily affecting shoulders, neck, and pelvic girdle</span>

# Diagnostics
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate</span> & C-reactive protein <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">(best initial test)</span>
	- Highly sensitive and almost always significantly elevated in GCA.
- Temporal artery biopsy: intimal thickening, elastic lamina fragmentation, multinucleated giant cells
