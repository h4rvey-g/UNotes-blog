Associated with [[./Thymoma|Thymoma]].
# Pathophysiology
## Thymus involvement
- Muscle-like (myoid) cells in the thymus express AChR → autoreactive targeting by T cells → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">production of acetylcholine receptor antibodies (AChR antibodies)</span>
## Acetylcholine receptor antibodies
- Responsible for inhibition of signal transduction at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ)
- Antibodies target postsynaptic AChRs of normal muscle cells → competitive inhibition of acetylcholine (ACh) → AChR decay through receptor internalization (↓ receptor density at the postsynaptic membrane) and activation of [[../Immunology/Complement system|complement]] (→ muscle cell lysis) → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">impaired signal transduction at the NMJ → skeletal muscle weakness and fatigue </span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230622145302.png|Pasted image 20230622145302.png]]
	- Seropositive MG (80–90% of cases): positive assays for antibodies (in blood) against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR-Ab)
	- Seronegative MG (10–20% of cases): negative for AChR antibodies, but may be positive for muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibodies (MuSK antibodies)
# Diagnostics
---
- Initial test: anti-AChR antibodies (highly specific for MG)
>[!warning] 
>Because MG and LEMS are neuromuscular junction disorders, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">muscle biopsy of these conditions will be normal</span>. Unlike in myopathies (e.g. [[./Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies|Polymyositis]], [[./Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies|Dermatomyositis]], [[../Biochemistry/Mitochondrial myopathies|Mitochondrial myopathies]])
# Differential diagnostics
---
## Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS)
- Etiology
	- Paraneoplastic: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">associated with small-cell lung carcinoma (in ⅔ of patients with LEMS)</span>
- Pathophysiology: autoantibodies directed against presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels (anti-VGCC antibodies) → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx → ↓ presynaptic vesicle fusion → impaired acetylcholine release in the NMJ</span>

>[!tip] 
> 1. Extraocular muscles: move frequently, so they are first affected.
> 2. MG: Repeated nerve stimulation → decreasing ACh release (as the storage is limited) → worsen symptoms
> 3. LEMS: More depolarization → more ACh release → improved symptoms
