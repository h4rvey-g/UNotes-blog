- Ductal-dependent CHDs: a group of CHDs that require the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)</span>, which supplies either pulmonary or systemic circulation, to sustain life until surgery can be performed 
	- PDA supplies systemic circulation in the following:
		- Transposition of the great arteries
		- Hypoplastic left heart syndrome
		- [[./Coarctation of the aorta|Coarctation of the aorta]]
	- PDA supplies pulmonary circulation in the following:
		- Tricuspid atresia
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Treatment: administration of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) infusion</span>
		- Example: IV alprostadil infusion
		- Mechanism of action: prevents the ductus arteriosus from closing, creating an intentional shunt to allow mixing of deoxygenated with oxygenated blood
