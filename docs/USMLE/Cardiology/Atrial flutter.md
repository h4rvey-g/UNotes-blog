- Narrow complex tachycardia
- Regular atrial activity at ~300 bpm
- Loss of the isoelectric baseline
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">“Saw-tooth” pattern of **inverted flutter** waves in leads II, III, aVF</span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230904205051.png|Pasted image 20230904205051.png]]
	- **_Anticlockwise Reentry:_** Commonest form of atrial flutter (90% of cases). Retrograde atrial conduction produces
		- Inverted flutter waves in leads II,III, aVF
		- Positive flutter waves in V1 — may resemble upright P waves
- Upright flutter waves in V1 that may resemble P waves
- Ventricular rate depends on AV conduction ratio (see below)
## **Handy Tips For Spotting Flutter**
### Rapid Recognition
- Narrow complex tachycardia at 150 bpm (range 130-170)? Yes -> Suspect flutter!
- Turn the ECG upside down and closely examine the inferior leads (II, III + aVF) for flutter waves
### [[./Vagal maneuver|Vagal Maneuvers]] +/- Adenosine
- Atrial flutter will not usually cardiovert with these techniques (unlike [[[Supraventricular tachycardia|AVNRT]]](https://litfl.com/supraventricular-tachycardia-svt-ecg-library/)), although typically there will be a transient period of increased AV block during which flutter waves may be unmasked
### RR intervals
- In atrial flutter with variable block the R-R intervals will be multiples of the P-P interval — e.g. assuming an atrial rate of 300bpm (P-P interval of 200 ms), the R-R interval would be 400 ms with 2:1 block, 600 ms with 3:1 block, and 800 ms with 4:1 block
- Look for identical R-R intervals occurring sporadically along the rhythm strip; then look to see whether there is a mathematical relationship between the various R-R intervals on the ECG
- In contrast, [[./Atrial fibrillation|atrial fibrillation]] will be completely irregular, with no patterns to be discerned within the R-R intervals
