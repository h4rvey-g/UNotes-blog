# Etiology


---
# Pathophysiology
- Effects of Afib
	- The atria contract rapidly but ineffectively and in an uncoordinated fashion → stasis of blood within the atria, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">especially in atrial appendage</span> → risk of thromboembolism and stroke![[../../assets/img/L26184.jpg|L26184.jpg]]
	- Irregular activation of the ventricles by conduction through the AV node → tachycardia

# Clinical features

# Diagnostics
## ECG
### QRS complex
- Typically narrow QRS complex (< 0.12 seconds)
- Wide QRS complex may be seen in some situations:
	- Aberrant conduction, e.g., bundle branch block or preexcitation (as seen in Afib with WPW)
	- Complete AV block with a ventricular escape rhythm
	- [[./Ashman phenomenon|Ashman phenomenon]]: intermittent aberrant ventricular conduction results in isolated or short runs of wide QRS complexes![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230825210145.png|Pasted image 20230825210145.png]]

>[!warning] 
>Wide QRS complex may indicate preexcited Afib or aberrant conduction.

# Treatment
- First-line
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[./Beta blockers|Beta blockers]]</span>: e.g., metoprolol, atenolol, propranolol
		- Via blockade of sympathetic tone
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Work well both during rest and exercise</span>
		- Preferred when Afib is due to [[../Endocrine/Hyperthyroidism|hyperthyroidism]] and in pregnant patients
		- Avoid in patients with [[../Respiratory/Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]] and acute decompensated [[./Heart failure|heart failure]] (ADHF).
	- OR nondihydropyridine [[./Calcium Channel|calcium channel]] blockers (ndHP [[../Pharmacology/Calcium channel blockers|CCBs]]): e.g., diltiazem, verapamil
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Work well both during rest and exercise</span>
		- Avoid in patients with ADHF. 
		- Can be safely used in [[./Heart failure|heart failure]] with preserved normal LV systolic function.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Second-line: [[./Cardiac glycosides|digoxin]]</span>; preferred initial therapy for patients with ADHF
	- Via increased parasympathetic tone
	- This mechanism is <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">effective at rest, when sympathetic tone is low, but it poorly controls ventricular rate during exercise</span>, when high levels of sympathetic tone accelerate AV node conduction.
- Third-line: amiodarone; typically reserved for patients in whom all other options have failed
