# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- Often accompanied by a bicuspid aortic valve , VSD, and/or PDA

---
# Pathophysiology
- Genetic defects and/or intrauterine ischemia → medial thickening and intimal hyperplasia → formation of a ridge encircling the aortic lumen → narrowing of the aorta → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ flow proximal to the narrowing and ↓ flow distal to the narrowing </span>
	- Coarctation is most commonly juxtaductal.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The coarctation most commonly occurs distal to the left subclavian artery, where the ductus arteriosus originates.</span>
	- Rarely, the coarctation occurs in the lower segments of the thoracic aorta or in the abdominal aorta
- In discrete coarctation: left ventricular outflow obstruction → myocardial hypertrophy and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased collateral blood flow (e.g., intercostal vessels, scapular vessels).</span>
- In long-segment coarctation: closure of PDA after birth → left ventricular pressure and volume overload → hypoperfusion of organs and extremities distal to the stenosis

# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Differential cyanosis: cyanosis of the lower extremities </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Brachial-femoral delay: weak femoral pulses</span>
- ↑ Blood pressure (BP) in upper extremities and ↓ BP in lower extremities
	- In distal narrowing of the left subclavian artery: ↑ BP in both arms and ↓ BP in both legs
	- In origin of left subclavian artery is involved: BP in the right arm > in left arm 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cold feet and lower-extremity claudication upon physical exertion</span>
- Strong apical impulse displaced to the left
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Headache, [[../Respiratory/Epistaxis|epistaxis]], tinnitus </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Caused by brachiocephalic hypertension</span>
- In severe stenosis: shock and multiorgan failure when ductus arteriosus closes 
- Auscultation
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Systolic ejection murmur over left posterior hemithorax</span>
		- Due to blood flow through the aortic narrowing
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Continuous murmur below the left clavicula and between the shoulder blades </span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Due to collateral flow</span>
