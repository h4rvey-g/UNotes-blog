## Clinical features
- Clinical features of CV drug poisoning: typically <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">bradycardia, hypotension, and CNS depression</span>
- Other features
	- Delirium
	- Respiratory depression
	- Seizures (typically seen with propranolol) 
	- Bronchospasm (rare)
## Management
- Hypotension: IV fluid bolus
- Symptomatic bradycardia: atropine
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">High-dose glucagon therapy</span>
	- Glucagon activates adenylate cyclase, leading to increased intracellular cAMP during depolarization, which improves cardiac contractility and heart rate.
