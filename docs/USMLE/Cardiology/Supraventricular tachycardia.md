# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Palpitations</span>
- Fatigue
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Chest pain or discomfort</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dyspnea</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dizziness or presyncope</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Syncope</span> (uncommon; occurs more frequently in older adults)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Diaphoresis</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Symptom onset and resolution are typically abrupt, in contrast to sinus tachycardia (in which onset and resolution are more gradual).</span>

>Signs of unstable tachycardia due to SVT include acute pulmonary edema, <font color="#ffc000">hypotension</font>, severe chest pain, and altered mental status.
# Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome
WPW syndrome is a specific form of pre-excitation syndrome characterized by a <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">congenital</mark> accessory pathway and tachyarrhythmias, while pre-excitation syndrome is a broader term that encompasses various syndromes involving early ventricular activation.a
## ECG
- PR interval < 120ms
- [Delta wave](https://litfl.com/delta-wave-ecg-library/): slurring slow rise of initial portion of the QRS
	- The Delta wave is a slurred upstroke in the QRS complex.![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230819222341.png|Pasted image 20230819222341.png]]
- QRS prolongation > 110ms
- Discordant ST-segment and T-wave changes (i.e. in the opposite direction to the major component of the QRS complex)
- Pseudo-infarction pattern in up to 70% of patients — due to negatively deflected delta waves in inferior/anterior leads (“pseudo-Q waves”), or prominent R waves in V1-3 (mimicking posterior infarction)![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230819222745.png|Pasted image 20230819222745.png]]
# AVNRT (Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia)
[P wave](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/pl0LBT#Z322a8570694c6bce37349457185e57ec) is typically not visible (it falls in or is "buried" in the [QRS complex](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/pl0LBT#Zb6a46f472e496e639cee60c43bd0acbd))![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240209152845.png|Pasted image 20240209152845.png]]

>[!tip] 
>- Regular tachycardia ~140-280 bpm
>- Narrow QRS complexes (< 120ms) unless there is co-existing bundle branch block, accessory pathway, or rate-related aberrant conduction
>- P waves if visible exhibit retrograde conduction with P-wave inversion in leads II, III, aVF. They may be buried within, visible after, or very rarely visible before the QRS complex![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230827214147.png|Pasted image 20230827214147.png]]
# SVT vs Sinus tachycardia
The real difference is the rate, practically.
SVT is generally 150 and above. Sinus tach is 100-150.
