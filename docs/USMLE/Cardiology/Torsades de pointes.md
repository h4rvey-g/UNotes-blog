# Etiology
- Congenital [[./Long QT syndromes|Long QT syndromes]]
- Acquired [[./Long QT syndromes|LQTS]] (e.g., drug-induced [[./Long QT syndromes|LQTS]], electrolyte abnormalities, heart disease)

# Pathophysiology

---
# Clinical features
- Often asymptomatic
- Cardiovascular features
	- Palpitations
	- Tachycardia (HR â‰¥100/min; typically regular)
	- Chest pain/pressure 
	- Dyspnea, orthopnea
	- Symptoms of reduced cardiac output
		- Dizziness
		- Hypotension
		- Syncope 
		- Cardiogenic shock and loss of consciousness
- Cardiac arrest

# Diagnostics
- Polymorphic VT with QRS complexes that typically appear to twist around the isoelectric line, usually in self-limiting bursts
- Often preceded by bigeminy and followed by several premature ventricular contractions
- R-on-T phenomenon may also be seen.

---
# Treatment
- Hemodynamically unstable patients: Defibrillation plus CPR. 
- Hemodynamically stable patients: Administer IV magnesium sulfate. 
- Identify and treat the underlying etiology of QT prolongation.
