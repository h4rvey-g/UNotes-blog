# Etiology
- Acquired
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypertension (most common risk factor)</span>
	- Trauma, e.g., deceleration injury in a motor vehicle collision, or iatrogenic injury during valve replacements or graft surgery (traumatic aortic dissection)
	- [[../MSK/Vasculitides|Vasculitis]] with aortic involvement (e.g., syphilis, Takayasu arteritis)
- Congenital
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Connective tissue disease ([[../Pathology/Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome|Marfan syndrome]], [[../Pathology/Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome|Ehlers-Danlos syndrome]]) </span>
	- Bicuspid aortic valve (e.g., in [[../Reproductive/Turner syndrome|Turner syndrome]])

## Pathology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cystic medial degeneration: a degeneration (necrosis) of large blood vessels such as the aorta. </span>
	- Seen in disorders that cause increased arterial wall stress (e.g., hypertension, [[./Coarctation of the aorta|coarctation of the aorta]]) as well as connective tissue disorders (especially [[../Pathology/Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome|Marfan syndrome]])
	- Can lead to aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection
	- Histopathology ![[../../assets/img/L28141.jpg|L28141.jpg]]
		- Loss, thinning, disorganization, and fragmentation of elastic tissue in the media
		- Accumulation of mucoid extracellular matrix
		- Loss of smooth muscle nuclei

# Complications
- Aortic rupture and acute blood loss: acute back and flank pain (tearing pain), symptoms of shock → indication for emergency surgery
- Complications of Stanford type A dissections
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Myocardial infarction (coronary artery occlusion)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Aortic regurgitation (extension of the dissection into the aortic valve)</span>
	- Cardiac tamponade progressing to cardiogenic shock
	- Stroke (extension of the dissection into the carotids)
- Complications of both Stanford type A dissection and Stanford type B dissections
	- Arterial occlusion followed by ischemia of the:
		- Celiac trunk, superior/inferior mesenteric artery → acute abdomen, ischemic colitis
		- Renal arteries → [[../Renal/Acute kidney injury|acute renal failure]] (oliguria, anuria)
		- Spinal arteries → weakness of lower extremities or acute paraplegia
