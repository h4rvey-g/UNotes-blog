# Definitions
- Arteriosclerosis: an umbrella term to describe arterial wall thickening (hardening) and elasticity loss with variable pathogenesis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Atherosclerosis</span>
	- Most common type of arteriosclerosis
	- Multifactorial inflammatory disease of the intima, manifesting at points of hemodynamic shear stress
	- Characterized by a build-up of cholesterol plaques in the tunica intima 
	- Affects elastic arteries and large/medium-sized muscular arteries
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Monckeberg arteriosclerosis</span>
	- A form of arteriosclerosis characterized by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">dystrophic calcification of the tunica media and internal elastic lamina</span>
	- There is <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">no blood flow obstruction. </span>
		- The intimal layer of the artery is not involved.
	- Mainly affects medium-sized arteries
	- Causes: [[../Endocrine/Diabetes mellitus|diabetes mellitus]] and/or progressive kidney disease

# Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis
![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240226173230.png|Pasted image 20240226173230.png]]
1. Chronic stress on the endothelium (e.g., due to arterial hypertension and turbulence)
2. Endothelial cell dysfunction, which leads to:
	- Invasion of inflammatory cells (mainly monocytes and lymphocytes) through the disrupted endothelial barrier
	- Adhesion of platelets to the damaged vessel wall → platelet release of inflammatory mediators (e.g., cytokines) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)
	- PDGF stimulates the migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in the tunica intima and mediates the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts
3. Inflammation of the vessel wall
4. Macrophages and SMCs ingest cholesterol from oxidized LDL  and transform into foam cells (macrophages filled with lipid droplets). 
5. Foam cells accumulate to form fatty streaks (early atherosclerotic lesions).
6. Lipid-laden macrophages and SMCs produce extracellular matrix (e.g., [[../Biochemistry/Collagen|collagen]]) deposition → development of a fibrous plaque (atheroma) 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Macrophages, smooth muscle cells, lymphocytes, and extracellular matrix form a fibrous cap, which covers a necrotic center, consisting of foam cells, free cholesterol crystals, and cellular debris.</span>
7. Inflammatory cells in the atheroma (e.g., macrophages) secrete <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">matrix metalloproteinases → weakening of the fibrous cap of the plaque due to the breakdown of extracellular matrix → minor stress ruptures the fibrous cap</span>
8. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Calcification of the intima</span> (the amount and pattern of calcification affect the risk of complications) 
9. Plaque rupture → exposure of thrombogenic material (e.g., [[../Biochemistry/Collagen|collagen]]) → thrombus formation with vascular occlusion or spreading of thrombogenic material
