ECG features of pericarditis
Not all patients go through all stages and manifestations may vary. In particular, pericarditis due to uremia may not involve characteristic ECG changes. 
Stage 1: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">diffuse ST elevations, ST depression in aVR and V1, PR segment depression </mark>
Stage 2: ST segment normalizes in ∼ 1 week.
Stage 3: inverted T waves
Stage 4: ECG returns to normal baseline (as prior to onset of pericarditis) after weeks to months.

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">In contrast to myocardial infarction, pericarditis is characterized by a diffuse distribution of ST elevations on ECG.See also “Differential diagnoses of ST elevations on ECG.”</mark>

- First, the diffuseness of the ST elevations (I, II, III, aVF, V3-V6). In myocardial infarction the ST elevations tend to be localized (inferior, anterior, posterior, lateral), often, but not always with reciprocal ST depressions.
- Second, the PR segment displacement which has been attributed to subepicardial atrial injury.
