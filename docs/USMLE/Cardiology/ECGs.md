# Tachycardia DDx
![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230620213926.png|800]]
The differential diagnosis of a regular narrow tachycardia in general includes 5 major mechanisms: 
- Sinus tachycardia 
- [[./Supraventricular tachycardia|AVNRT]] 
- Atrial tachycardia 
- Orthodromic atrio-ventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) involving retrograde conduction over a "concealed" bypass tract 
- [[./Atrial flutter|Atrial flutter]] with 2:1 block
# Bradycardia DDx
![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230623214843.png|Pasted image 20230623214843.png]]
#  Whenever you see a negative P wave and QRS complex in lead I the likely diagnosis is limb [[lead reversal|lead reversal]].
# Multifocal atrial rhythm
![Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia (MAT) • At least 3 different ... | GrepMed](https://img.grepmed.com/uploads/5407/multifocal-tachycardia-ecg-cardiology-diagnosis-original.png)
**Differentiate from <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">[[./ectopic atrial rhythm|ectopic atrial rhythm]]</mark>.** In [[./ectopic atrial rhythm|ectopic atrial rhythm]], the P-wave morphology remains consistent as the PACs originate from a single ectopic focus. In contrast, multifocal atrial rhythm shows varying P-wave morphologies from beat to beat, reflecting the random discharge of multiple ectopic atrial foci .
#  Early repolarization
![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230617214946.png|Pasted image 20230617214946]]
on the LEFT, the T wave repolarization looks like a continuation of the S wave. This is not ST elevation and is seen often in young adults. It is called benign early repolarization. On the right, you clearly see the completion of the S wave and a clear ST Segment which allows you to do an accurate ST Elevation measurement.
# Premature Atrial Complex (PAC)
A premature atrial complex (PAC) is a <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">premature beat arising from ectopic pacemaking tissue within the atria</mark>. There is an abnormal P wave, usually followed by a normal QRS complex. AKA: Atrial ectopics, atrial extrasystoles, atrial premature beats, atrial premature depolarisations.
![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230813210013.png|Pasted image 20230813210013.png]]
>[!tip] 
>- Abnormal (non-sinus) P wave usually followed by a normal QRS complex (< 120 ms)
>	- PACs arising close to the AV node (“low atrial” ectopics) cause <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">retrograde activation</mark> of the atria, producing an<mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;"> inverted P wave</mark> with a relatively short PR interval ≥ 120 ms (PR interval < 120 ms is classified as a PJC)
>	- The abnormal P wave may be hidden in the preceding T wave, producing a “peaked” or “camel hump” appearance
>- Post-extrasystolic pauses may be present — PACs that reach the SA node may depolarise it, causing the SA node to be “reset”, with a longer-than-normal interval before the next sinus beat arrives
>- PACs may also be conducted aberrantly (usually RBBB morphology), or not conducted at all. P waves will still be visible in both cases

# Premature Ventricular Complex (PVC)
- Broad QRS complex (≥ 120 ms) with abnormal morphology
- Premature — i.e. occurs earlier than would be expected for the next sinus impulse
- Discordant ST segment and T wave changes.
	-  ST segment and T wave are directed opposite to the main vector of the QRS complex
- Usually followed by a full compensatory pause
- Retrograde capture of the atria may or may not occur
![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230822211003.png|Pasted image 20230822211003.png]]
# Junctional Escape Rhythm
- Junctional rhythm with a rate of 40-60 bpm
- QRS complexes are typically narrow (< 120 ms)
- No relationship between the QRS complexes and any preceding atrial activity (e.g. P-waves, flutter waves, fibrillatory waves)![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230901211330.png|Pasted image 20230901211330.png]]
## Mechanism
Pacemaker cells are found at various sites throughout the conducting system, with each site capable of independently sustaining the heart rhythm. The rate of spontaneous depolarization of pacemaker cells decreases down the conducting system:
- SA node (60-100 bpm)
- Atria (< 60 bpm)
- AV node (40-60 bpm)
- Ventricles (20-40 bpm)
Under normal conditions, subsidiary pacemakers are suppressed by the more rapid impulses from above (i.e. sinus rhythm). <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Junctional and ventricular escape rhythms arise when the rate of supraventricular impulses arriving at the AV node or ventricle is less than the intrinsic rate of the ectopic pacemaker.</span>
>[!tip] Terminology
>- **Junctional bradycardia** = junctional rhythm at a rate of < 40 bpm
>- **Junctional escape rhythm** = junctional rhythm at a rate of 40-60 bpm
>- **Accelerated junctional rhythm** = junctional rhythm at 60-100 bpm
>- **Junctional tachycardia** = junctional rhythm at > 100 bpm

>Hypokalemia, hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia all appear to prolong the QT interval, but they do so for different reasons: 
>- Hypokalemia prolongs the QU interval which can be mistaken for the QT interval
>- Hypocalcemia prolongs the ST segment (resulting in a long QT with a normal T wave)
>- Hypomagnesemia prolongs the T wave (resulting in a long QT with a long T wave)

# Bundle Branch Block
mnemonic: William Marrow
![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230622220505.png|Pasted image 20230622220505.png]]
In left bundle branch block
- The R wave in the lateral leads may be either “M-shaped”, notched, monophasic, or an RS complex![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230803202721.png|Pasted image 20230803202721.png]]
In right bundle branch block, the right precordial leads will show <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">ST-segment depression and T-wave inversion</mark>. Similarly, in left bundle branch block, ST-segment depression and T-wave inversion can be seen in the left lateral leads.
# Mitral stenosis
Characteristic findings include:
- Left atrial enlargement/P mitrale (widened and biphasic P wave)
- [[./Atrial flutter|Atrial flutter]]  
- Right ventricular hypertrophy (e.g., right axis deviation, dominant R wave in lead V1)

# Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm
AIVR, also known as Accelerated Ventricular Rhythm, results when the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">rate of an ectopic ventricular pacemaker exceeds that of the sinus node</span>. Often associated with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased vagal tone and decreased sympathetic tone</span>.
## Features
- Regular rhythm
- Rate typically 50-120 bpm
- Three or more ventricular complexes; QRS duration > 120ms
- Fusion and capture beats
## Pathophysiology
- Proposed mechanism is <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">enhanced automaticity of ventricular pacemaker</span>, although triggered activity may play a role, particularly in ischemia and digoxin toxicity
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">AIVR is classically seen in the reperfusion phase of an acute STEMI, e.g. post thrombolysis</span>
- Usually a well-tolerated, benign, self-limiting arrhythmia
# STEMI
![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230623220754.png|Pasted image 20230623220754.png]]
Timeline of ECG changes in STEMI
The sequence of ECG changes over several hours to days: hyperacute T wave → ST elevation → pathological Q wave → T-wave inversion → ST normalization → T-wave normalization

## Ventricular aneurysm
The pattern of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">persistent anterior ST elevation (> 2 weeks after STEMI)</span> plus <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">pathological Q waves</span> has a sensitivity of 38% and a specificity of 84% for the diagnosis of ventricular aneurysm.![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230827215152.png|Pasted image 20230827215152.png]]
# ECG Motion Artefacts
## **Parkinsonian tremor:**
![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230722214804.png|Pasted image 20230722214804.png]]
- The irregular baseline in this ECG gives the appearance of [[./Atrial fibrillation|atrial fibrillation]]
- The slow regular rhythm even suggests the possibility of [[./Atrial fibrillation|atrial fibrillation]] with complete heart block and a junctional escape rhythm
- However, on closer inspection there are visible P waves in V3 (circled)
- This patient had sinus bradycardia and a resting tremor due to Parkinson’s disease
# Miscellaneous
## P wave
Time: < 0.12s = 3 small block
Voltage: <0.25mV = 2.5 small block
<mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">The P wave in V1 is **often biphasic**.</mark> Early right atrial forces are directed anteriorly, giving rise to an initial positive deflection; these are followed by left atrial forces travelling posteriorly, producing a later negative deflection.
Thus, 
- **P mitrale (widened and biphasic P wave): Mitral stenosis, causing left atrium hypertrophy**
- **Peaked P wave: Pulmonary hypertension, causing right atrium hypertrophy**
![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230620211202.png|Pasted image 20230620211202.png]]
In [[./Supraventricular tachycardia|AVNRT]], The <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">retrograde P</mark> wave (or Atrial echo) **shows up at the end of the QRS**. Best observed in lead II or III. Also, <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">Retrograde P</mark> wave (aka pseudo-R' wave) is seen in V1.
![[../../assets/img/127701f042d46e7958a823fce6249be.jpg|127701f042d46e7958a823fce6249be.jpg]]

## ST segment
Time: 0.05-0.15s = 1-3 small block
Elevation: ≥ 0.1 mV in a limb lead or ≥ 0.2 mV in a precordial lead. 
Depression: ≥ 0.05 mV (or 0.5 mm) in leads V2 and V3 or ≥ 0.1 mV in all other leads.
- Downsloping ST depression or horizontal ST depression: Subendocardial myocardial ischemia, i.e., **NSTEMI**
- Sagging type ST-segment depression: digoxin
- Secondary repolarization abnormalities: Ventricular hypertrophy, LBBB
- Nonspecific ST-segment depression: Hypokalemia
## T wave
### Pathophysiology of abnormalities
- Ventricular repolarization vector directed away from the electrode of the ECG lead
- Changes in myocardial cellular electrophysiology (e.g., during ischemia or infarction)
- Changes in the sequence of ventricular activation (e.g., in bundle branch blocks or cardiac hypertrophy)
### Classifications
- Peaked T wave
	- Hyperkalemia
	- High vagal tone
	- Early stages of a STEMI
	- Prinzmetal angina
- T wave inversion (inverted T wave)
	- May be a normal finding in:
		- Leads III, aVR, or <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">V1</span>
		- Children
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">Coronary artery disease (myocardial ischemia)</mark>
	- Bundle branch blocks
	- [[../Respiratory/Pulmonary embolism|Pulmonary embolism]]  
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">Perimyocarditis </mark>

	- Digoxin
	- [[../Neurology/Intracranial hemorrhage|Intracranial hemorrhage]]  
	- Persistent juvenile T-wave pattern
	- Wellens syndrome
## QT interval
The QT interval includes the QRS complex, the ST segment, and the T wave.
- The two chief causes of a short QT are <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">[[./Hypercalcemia|hypercalcemia]]</mark> and <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">digoxin therapy</mark> (associated with characteristic "scooping" of the ST-T complex). A third and relatively rare cause is <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">hereditary short QT</mark> ("channelopathy"-related) that may be associated with ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac arrest.
	- Digoxin: The inhibition of the sodium/potassium atpase <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decreases the amount of intracellular potassium, which causes an increase in potassium influx during repolarization, shortening the qt interval</span>
	- Digoxin increases parasympathetic tone, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">lengthening the pr interval</span>
- Prolonged QT: Congenital [[./Long QT syndromes|Long QT syndromes]], Drug side effects (e.g., antiarrhythmic agents, antidepressants, antipsychotics, phenothiazines, 1st-generation antihistamines, some antibiotics), Electrolyte disturbances (e.g., <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">[[Hypocalcemia|Hypocalcemia]], hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia</mark>), Cardiac abnormalities (e.g., inflammatory heart diseases, bradycardia, myocardial ischemia), [[../Biochemistry/Arsenic toxicity|Arsenic poisoning]]
## Rates
- [[./Atrial flutter|Atrial flutter]]: 250-300/min -- about 1 small block
- [[./Atrial fibrillation|Atrial fibrillation]]: 350-400/min -- less than 1 small block
- Atrial tachycardia, [[./Supraventricular tachycardia|AVNRT]]: 130-240 -- 1-2 small block
- Ventricular tachycardia: >100 -- less than 3 small blocks
