# Etiology
- Previous infection with group A β-hemolytic streptococcus (GAS), also referred to as [[../Infective disease/Streptococcus pyogenes|Streptococcus pyogenes]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Usually acute tonsillitis or pharyngitis (“strep throat”)</span>
	- GAS infections of the skin (e.g., erysipelas, impetigo, cellulitis) tend to be complicated by [[../Renal/Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis|poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis]] rather than rheumatic fever.

---
# Pathophysiology
- Most commonly accepted mechanism involves the following: acute tonsillitis/pharyngitis caused by GAS without antibiotic treatment → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">development of antibodies against streptococcal M protein → cross-reaction of antibodies with nerve and myocardial proteins (most commonly myosins)</span> due to molecular mimicry → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">type II hypersensitivity reaction</span> → acute inflammatory sequela

# Clinical features
- CNS: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sydenham chorea (involuntary, irregular, nonrepetitive movements of the limbs, neck, head, and/or face)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Occurs 1–8 months after the inciting infection</span>
		- In contrast to the other rheumatic manifestations, which usually occur within 3 weeks after initial infection.
	- Pathophysiology: Streptococcal antigens lead to antibody production → antibodies<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> cross-react with structures of the basal ganglia (particularly the striatum) and cortical structures → reversible dysfunction of cortical and striatal circuits</span>
	- Clinical features
		- Sometimes asymmetrical or confined to one side (hemichorea)
		- Additional <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">motor symptoms (e.g., ballismus, muscle weakness) and speech disorders (slurred or “jerky” speech)</span>
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Milkmaid grip: characterized by the inability to maintain muscle contraction in the hands → intermittent loss of contraction results in alternating squeeze and release of grip ("milking")</span>
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Choreic hand: characterized by intermittent wrist flexion with extension of the digits (“spooning” of the hand)</span>
		- Neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g., inappropriate laughing/crying, agitation, anxiety, apathy, obsessive-compulsive behavior)
- Skin
	- Subcutaneous nodules 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Erythema marginatum</span>: centrifugally expanding pink or light red rash with a well-defined outer border and central clearing. ![[../../assets/img/L10619.png|L10619.png]]
		- Painless and nonpruritic

>[!Mnemonic] 
>- Major criteria: SPACE
>	- Subcutaneous nodules
>	- Pancarditis
>	- Arthritis (Polyarthritis; for moderate to high-risk population – monoarthritis also qualifies)
>	- Chorea
>	- Erythema marginatum
>
>- Minor criteria: LEAF
>	- Long PR interval
>	- ESR ≥ 60mm/hr (or ≥ 30mm/hr in moderate to high-risk population) and CRP ≥ 3mg/dl
>	- Arthralgia (Polyarthralgia; for moderate to high-risk population – monoarthralgia also qualifies)
>	- Fever ( ≥ 38.5c; ≥ 38c for moderate to high-risk population )

## ECG
- Most common: prolonged PR interval (first-degree AV block)  
- Potential additional findings include:
	- Second-degree AV block 
	- Complete heart block 
	- Sinus tachycardia
	- Accelerated junctional rhythm
	- ECG features of pericarditis

>[!tip] 
>Whenever you see marked <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">left atrial abnormality or [[./Atrial fibrillation|atrial fibrillation]] in the presence of right ventricular hypertrophy signs</span>, always think about rheumatic mitral valve disease. [[./Mitral valve stenosis|Mitral stenosis]] is the only single lesion that can readily account for the combination of left atrial enlargement and right ventricular hypertrophy.
## Pathology
- Myocardial findings
	- Aschoff bodies 
		- Granuloma of rheumatic inflammation
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Central area of fibrinoid necrosis</span>
		- Surrounded by characteristic multinucleated giant cells (Aschoff cells) and other inflammatory cells (mononuclear cells, plasma cells, and T lymphocytes) due to a [[../Immunology/Type IV hypersensitivity reaction|type IV hypersensitivity reaction]]. ![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240120172139.png|Pasted image 20240120172139.png]]
	- Anitschkow cells
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cardiac histiocytes (mononuclear cells) appearing in Aschoff bodies</span>
		- Large and elongated cells
		- Longitudinal section: ovoid nucleus containing wavy, caterpillar-like bar of chromatin (caterpillar cell)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Transverse section: owl-eye appearance </span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240120172347.png|Pasted image 20240120172347.png]]
