## Pathology
- Sputum analysis in patients with pulmonary edema may show <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">heart failure cells (hemosiderin-containing cells).</span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240228101505.png|Pasted image 20240228101505.png]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pulmonary venous congestion may result in intra-alveolar bleeding. Macrophages that subsequently phagocytose the erythrocytes are called “heart failure cells.”</span> These cells may also be detected in the sputum of patients with pulmonary infarction, [[../MSK/Vasculitides|vasculitis]], or aspiration of blood.
	- Their color is most likely due to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hemosiderin from ingested erythrocytes.</span>
