Ashman phenomenon occurs when a short RR interval is preceded by a long RR interval. When the new atrial impulse reaches the still refractory bundle of His, it is typically <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">transmitted only through the left bundle</mark> (which has a shorter refractory period than the right). The resultant appearance is <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">morphologically similar to RBBB</mark>. Ashman phenomenon may be mistaken for a premature ventricular complex or ventricular tachycardia.
