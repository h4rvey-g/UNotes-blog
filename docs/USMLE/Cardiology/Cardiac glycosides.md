# Digoxin poisoning
## Risk factors
- Electrolyte imbalances
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypokalemia: digoxin competes with K<sup>+</sup> for binding to Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase</span>
- Medical conditions
	- Renal failure (reduced digoxin excretion)
	- Volume depletion (e.g., treatment with diuretics)
- Drug interactions
	- Treatment with verapamil, diltiazem, amiodarone, and/or quinidine: These drugs may displace digoxin from tissue binding sites and decrease renal elimination. 
		- Both mechanisms of action lead to increased digoxin serum levels.
## Clinical features
- Acute and chronic poisoning: Symptoms are less obvious in chronic poisoning.
	- Vagal symptoms: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, anorexia
	- Arrhythmia symptoms: palpitations, syncope, and presyncope 
- Chronic poisoning
	- Confusion, fatigue, lethargy, weakness, and disorientation
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Visual disturbances</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Blurred vision, halos, scotomas, diplopia</span>
		- Photophobia
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Xanthopsia (yellow-tinted vision)</span>
