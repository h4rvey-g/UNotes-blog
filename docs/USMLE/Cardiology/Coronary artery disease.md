## Approach
- All patients: pharmacotherapy for CAD
	- Start prevention of recurrent CAD, i.e., antiplatelet agents, statins, and management of comorbidities.
	- Start antianginal medication.
## Pharmacotherapy for CAD
### Antianginal drugs
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Goal: reduction of myocardial oxygen demand (MVO2)</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">First-line agent: [[./Beta blockers|beta blockers]]</span>
- Second-line agents: [[../Pharmacology/Calcium channel blockers|CCBs]], [[../Pharmacology/Nitrates|nitrates]], ranolazine
- Third-line agent: Consider ranolazine if beta-blockers, [[../Pharmacology/Calcium channel blockers|CCBs]], and [[../Pharmacology/Nitrates|nitrates]] are ineffective or not tolerated.

### Prevention of recurrence and/or progression
- Antiplatelet agents
- ACEIs or ARBs
- [[./Beta blockers|Beta blockers]]

# Subtypes and variants

## Vasospastic angina
Previously known as variant or Prinzmetal angina
### Description
- Angina caused by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">transient coronary spasms</span> (usually due to spasms occurring close to areas of coronary stenosis)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Not affected by exertion (may also occur at rest)</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Typically occurs early in the morning</span>
### Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cigarette smoking</span>; use of stimulants (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines), alcohol, or triptans
- Stress, hyperventilation, exposure to cold
- Common atherosclerotic risk factors (except smoking) do not apply to vasospastic angina.
### Pathogenesis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hyperreactivity of coronary smooth muscle due to endothelial dysfunction & autonomic imbalance</span>
	- Triggered by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">excess vagal tone</span>, and they occur <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">most commonly at night when vagal tone is at a peak.</span>
	- Both <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Neurology/Neurotransmitters|acetylcholine]] and ergot alkaloids (eg, dihydroergotamine) provoke symptoms</span> and may also aid in diagnosis, as follows:
		- Acetylcholine normally stimulates endothelial muscarinic receptors to cause vasodilation via increased release of nitric oxide.  However, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">a deficiency of endothelial nitric oxide in affected patients causes increased vagal tone to instead trigger vasoconstriction</span> and precipitate vasospastic symptoms.
		- Ergot alkaloids activate 5-HT2 serotonergic receptors to cause vasoconstriction.  Normally, the vasoconstriction is somewhat offset by endothelial release of vasodilatory prostaglandins, but this response is lacking in affected patients due to endothelial dysfunction.
### Clinical presentation
- Young age (<50)
- Minimal CAD risk factors (other than smoking)
- Recurrent chest discomfort
- At rest or during sleep
- Spontaneous resolution â‰¤15 min
### Diagnosis
- ECG: ST-segment elevation during episode
- Coronary angiography: no CAD
