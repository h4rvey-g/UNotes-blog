- Renal: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Acute hypertensive nephrosclerosis (formerly malignant nephrosclerosis)</span>
	- [[../Renal/Acute kidney injury|Acute kidney injury]] (azotemia and/or oliguria, edema) and microhematuria
	- Pathophysiology: severe hypertension → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">acute thrombotic microangiopathy → thrombosis of glomerular capillaries and red blood cell extravasation and fragmentation as well as luminal thrombosis of arterioles → infarction and necrosis of endothelial and mesangial cells → decreased glomerular blood flow → acute kidney damage</span>
	- Histopathologic patterns
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fibrinoid necrosis</span>: Cell death and excessive fibrin deposition within the arteriolar walls is visible as circumferential, amorphous, pink material with smudged, necrotic endothelial cells that lack cytologic detail.
			- Acute, compared with hyaline [[./Atherosclerosis|Arteriolosclerosis]]
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hyperplastic [[./Atherosclerosis|arteriolosclerosis]]</span>:  Over time, activated platelets and injured endothelial cells release growth factors, which induce concentric hyperplasia and layering of smooth muscle cells and [[../Biochemistry/Collagen|collagen]], resulting in intimal thickening and an "onion-skin" appearance.
