# Epidemiology

# Etiology
- HCM is a genetic condition characterized by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">otherwise unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy. </span>
- Most common hereditary heart disease
	- Autosomal dominant inheritance with varying penetrance
	- Most commonly caused by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">mutations</span> of the sarcomeric protein genes (e.g., <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">myosin heavy chain</span>, myosin binding protein C) → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">disorganization of myocyte</span> architecture characterized by myofibrillar disarray and fibrosis![[../../assets/img/L65544.jpg|L65544.jpg]]
- Other conditions that are associated with left-ventricular hypertrophy include the following:
	- Chronic hypertension (most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy)
	- [[./Aortic valve stenosis|Aortic stenosis]]
	- [[../Neurology/Friedreich ataxia|Friedreich ataxia]], [[../Biochemistry/Lysosomal Storage Diseases|Fabry disease]], Noonan syndrome

# Pathophysiology
>[!tip] 
>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy shows <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">localized, asymmetrical</span>, rather than uniform, thickening of the LV walls, predominantly affecting the interventricular <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">septum</span>.
>This is different from hypertensive heart disease, which shows uniformly thickened left ventricular (LV) walls
## HOCM
- Mechanisms of obstruction
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve, results in mitral-septal contact during mid-to-late systole</span> ; caused by either or both:![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240120195607.png|Pasted image 20240120195607.png]]
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Venturi effect: accelerated blood flow through ventricular outflow tract creates negative pressure that pulls the mitral valve towards the septum → increased outflow tract obstruction</span>
		- Ejection against an elongated and distorted mitral valve causes leaflets to get pulled into the outflow tract → potential secondary mitral regurgitation 
	- Muscular obstruction
		- Encroachment of the LVOT by the hypertrophic septum
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">LVOT obstruction is dynamic </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The following factors can increase the degree of obstruction: ↑ LV contractility, ↓ preload, and ↓ afterload </span>
	- Clinically exacerbating factors 
		- These factors lead to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased heart contraction force</span> and cardiac output and, thus, enhance the ejection flow. This <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increases the Venturi effect</span> force described above.
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Physical exercise/stress</span>
		- Dehydration
		- Pharmacologic provocation (e.g., [[../Pharmacology/Diuretics|diuretics]], ACEIs/ARBs, [[./Cardiac glycosides|digoxin]], hydralazine)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[./Vagal maneuver|Valsalva maneuver]] (strain phase)</span>
			- Leads to decreased preload
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Compare with [[./Aortic valve stenosis|Aortic stenosis]], which alleviates upon [[./Vagal maneuver|Valsalva maneuver]]</span>

# Clinical features
- Symptoms: worsen with exercise, dehydration, and use of certain drugs (e.g., [[../Pharmacology/Diuretics|diuretics]], hydralazine, ACEIs/ARBs, [[./Cardiac glycosides|digoxin]])
	- Frequently asymptomatic (especially the nonobstructive type)
	- Exertional dyspnea
	- [[./Coronary artery disease|Angina]] pectoris 
	- Dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope
	- Palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sudden cardiac death (particularly during or after intense physical activity)</span>
- Physical examination 
	- Systolic ejection murmur (crescendo-decrescendo)  
		- Increases with [[./Vagal maneuver|Valsalva maneuver]], standing, inotropic drugs (e.g., [[./Cardiac glycosides|digitalis]]) 
		- Decreases with:
			- Hand grip, squatting, or passive leg elevation
			- Drugs that decrease cardiac contractility (e.g., [[./Beta blockers|beta blockers]])
	- Possible holosystolic murmur from mitral regurgitation
	- Sustained apex beat
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">S4 gallop</span>
	- Paradoxical split of S2 
	- Pulsus bisferiens: LV outflow obstruction causes a sudden quick rise of the pulse followed by a slower longer rise (biphasic pulse).
