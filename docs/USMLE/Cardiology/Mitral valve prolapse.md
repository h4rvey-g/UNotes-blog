- The most common underlying pathology in the case of mitral valve prolapse is <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">myxomatous degeneration (deposition of glycosaminoglycan such as dermatan sulfate) of the mitral valve due to a primary disease or connective tissue disorder</span>
	- Long, floppy mitral valve leaflets with excessive valvular tissue → the mitral annulus becomes dilated and the chordae tendineae become elongated (and may rupture) → prolapse of one or both mitral valve leaflets into the left atrium during systole
