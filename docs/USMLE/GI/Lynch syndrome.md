# Epidemiology
- Prevalence
	- Most common cause of inherited CRC
- Increased lifetime risk of associated cancers (by age 70) 
	- Endometrial cancer: up to 40%
	- [[./Gastric cancer|Gastric cancer]]: ∼ 10%
	- Ovarian tumors: ∼ 10%
	- Urothelial cancer: up to 10%
	- Skin: ∼ 4%

# Etiology
- Hereditary disease: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">autosomal dominant</span> with varying penetrance
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Mutations in various DNA mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) cause microsatellite instability.</span>
	- Increased occurrence of adenomas with ∼ 80% risk of progression to carcinomas

# Diagnostics

><span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">3-2-1 rule: (3 affected family members, 2 generations, 1 relative under 50 years of age).</span>

- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Amsterdam II criteria</span>
	- Presence of at least three relatives with a Lynch syndrome-associated cancer; all the following criteria should be present:
		- One should be a first-degree relative of the other two
		- At least two consecutive generations affected
		- At least one relative with a diagnosis before 50 years of age
		- Exclude cases of familial adenomatous polyposis.
		- Verify tumors with pathological examination.
