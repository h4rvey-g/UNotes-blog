# Treatment
## Antidiarrheal agents
- Bismuth subsalicylate
	- Converts to bismuth and salicylic acid in the GI tract
	- Has antisecretory, antimicrobial, and antiinflammatory effects
	- Can be used in bacterial diarrhea
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Loperamide</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Opioid receptor agonist that increases intestinal transit time </span>
		- Loperamide acts on intestinal Î¼-receptors and inhibits intestinal peristalsis and intestinal fluid secretion, and increases sphincter tone.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Best initial treatment for chemotherapy-induced diarrhea</span>
	- Cautions
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Should not be used for > 48 hours without reevaluation of the patient</span>

>[!warning] 
>Loperamide should be <font color="#ffc000">avoided in patients with suspected invasive diarrhea with inflammatory features</font>, as it reduces intestinal motility, which consequently <font color="#ffc000">increases the risk of bacterial colonization and invasion.</font>
