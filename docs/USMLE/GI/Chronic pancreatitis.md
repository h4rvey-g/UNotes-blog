# Epidemiology

# Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Chronic heavy alcohol use (most common, esp. men)</span>
- Pancreatic ductal obstruction
- Tobacco use
- Idiopathic pancreatitis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hereditary pancreatitis</span>
	- PRSS1 gene mutation
	- Age of onset < 20 years
	- Characterized by a positive family history and the absence of other risk factors
- Systemic disease
	- [[../Biochemistry/Cystic fibrosis|Cystic fibrosis]]
	- Severe hypertriglyceridemia (levels > 1,000 mg/dL)

## Pancreatic pseudocysts
### Definition
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Encapsulated collection of pancreatic fluid that develops 4 weeks after an acute attack of pancreatitis</span> (can occur in both acute and chronic pancreatitis)
### Pathophysiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pancreatic secretions leak from damaged ducts → inflammatory reaction of surrounding tissue → encapsulation of secretions by granulation tissue</span>
### Clinical features
- Often asymptomatic
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Painless abdominal mass</span>
- Pressure effects
	- Gastric outlet obstruction (early satiety, nonbilious vomiting, abdominal pain)
	- Obstruction of the distal duodenum (bilious vomiting) may result in [[./Steatorrhea|steatorrhea]].
	- Bile duct obstruction with jaundice
### Diagnostics
- First line: CT abdomen with contrast  
	- Findings: Extrapancreatic fluid collection within well-defined wall or capsule with contrast enhancement![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231127153909.png|Pasted image 20231127153909.png]]![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231127153916.png|Pasted image 20231127153916.png]]A large circumscribed fluid collection (green overlay) with an enhancing wall (red overlay) surrounds the pancreas (P).
