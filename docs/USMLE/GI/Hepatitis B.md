>Most cases are marked by significant <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">panlobular lymphocytic inflammation (ie, involving the entire lobule)</span>, which develops in response to the viral antigens.  To control the infection, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">cytotoxic T cells trigger apoptosis</span> of infected hepatocytes by binding death receptors (eg, Fas) on the plasma membrane and by secreting cytotoxic mediators (eg, perforins, granzymes).  As a result, a cascade of caspase enzymes breaks down hepatocyte proteins and DNA, leading to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation and fragmentation, and budding apoptotic bodies (ie, membrane-bound cellular fragments).</span>

# Pathophysiology
## Replication cycle of HBV
HBV carries a DNA polymerase with both DNA and RNA-dependent functions, also known as reverse transcriptase (RT).![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231217151303.png|Pasted image 20231217151303.png]]
1. After entering the host cell's nucleus, reverse transcriptase completes the positive strand of the virus's partially double-stranded relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA).
2. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The rcDNA is converted to covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA)</span> primarily by host enzymes in a process that is not entirely understood.
3. The cccDNA is then transcribed into viral mRNA by host RNA polymerase.
4. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The viral mRNA leaves the nucleus and is translated into HBV core proteins and new reverse transcriptase in the cytoplasm.</span>
5. Viral mRNA and reverse transcriptase are packaged into a capsid, where viral mRNA is then reverse-transcribed into viral rcDNA.
6. New viral DNA genomes are enveloped and leave the cell as progeny virions.

# Diagnostics
>[!tip] 
>- HBsAg: infection or not
>- Anti-HBc: acute (IgM) or chronic (IgG)
>- Anti-HBs: window or recovery
- Chronic infection (inactive): HBsAg (+), Anti-HBc (+, IgG), Anti-HBe (+)![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231213111859.png|Pasted image 20231213111859.png]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Recovery: conversion from HBsAg (+) to Anti-Hbs (+) in chronic infection, also HBV DNA needs to be undetectable</span>
- ![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231213112059.png|Pasted image 20231213112059.png]]
>[!tip] Window period
>During the window period, anti-HBc IgM and anti-HBe may be positive. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">But they don't give a clear picture of current infectiousness because they may indicate previous infection.</span>

- Breastfeeding may be started immediately if there are no contraindications (e.g., cracked or bleeding nipples), regardless of whether individuals:
	- Have HBsAg positive or unknown status
	- Are receiving [[../Infective disease/Antiviral therapy|antiviral therapy]]
