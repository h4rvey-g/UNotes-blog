# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- Parenteral
	- Needle sharing among individuals who use injection drugs 
	- Needlestick injury (e.g., health care workers)
	- Blood [[../Blood/Transfusion|transfusion]]
	- Dialysis
- Organ transplantation
- Sexual: rare (in contrast to [[./Hepatitis B|HBV]] and HIV)

# Pathophysiology


---
# Clinical features
## Incubation period
- 2 weeks to 6 months
## Chronic course
- Seen especially in asymptomatic individuals (up to 85%), as the disease may go undiagnosed and treatment may be delayed or never initiated (carrier state).
- Findings often mild, nonspecific (e.g., fatigue)
- Liver [[./Cirrhosis|cirrhosis]] (up to 25% of cases) within 20 years of infection
- Extrahepatic features of HCV (common) 
	- Hematological
		- Mixed cryoglobulinemia
		- Lymphoma (especially B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma)
		- [[../Blood/Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)|ITP]]
		- [[../Blood/Autoimmune hemolytic anemia|Autoimmune hemolytic anemia]]
		- Monoclonal gammopathies
	- Renal
		- [[../Renal/Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis|Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis]] (more common)
		- Membranous glomerulonephritis
	- Dermatological
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Porphyria cutanea tarda</span>
		- [[../MSK/Oral white lesions|Lichen planus]]
	- Endocrine
		- [[../Endocrine/Diabetes mellitus|Diabetes mellitus]]
		- Autoimmune thyroiditis (may lead to [[../Biochemistry/Hypothyroidism|hypothyroidism]])
	- Vascular: leukocytoclastic vasculitis

# Treatment
## Antiviral therapy
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs)</span>
	- Antivirals target and inhibit HCV-encoded proteins that are essential for the HCV replication cycle.
	- Example regimens
		- Glecaprevir PLUS pibrentasvir (all 6 genotypes)
		- Sofosbuvir PLUS velpatasvir (all 6 genotypes)
		- Ledipasvir PLUS sofosbuvir (genotypes 1, 4, 5, and 6)
- Interferon PLUS ribavirin
	- Was the preferred treatment before the development of DAAs
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Associated with severe adverse effects</span> (e.g., arthralgias, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, depression, anemia) and teratogenicity
	- Contraindicated in patients with decompensated [[./Cirrhosis|cirrhosis]] (high risk of worsening [[./Cirrhosis|cirrhosis]] decompensation)
	- Ribavirin
		- Mechanism of action
			- Guanosine analogue (nucleoside inhibitor)
			- Competitive inhibition of IMP dehydrogenase â†’ <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">prevention of guanine nucleosides synthesis</span>
		- Adverse effects
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hemolytic anemia</span>
			- Highly teratogenic

>[!tip] 
>DAAs have superior efficacy and safety profiles compared with interferon or ribavirin-based regimens and are thus preferred.
