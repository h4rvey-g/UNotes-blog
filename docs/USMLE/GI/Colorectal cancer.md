# Epidemiology
## Colorectal carcinogenesis pathways (molecular pathology) 
- Chromosomal instability pathway in colon cancer: The adenoma-carcinoma sequence is the progressive accumulation of mutations in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Pathology/Oncogenes|oncogenes]] (e.g., KRAS) and tumor suppressor genes (e.g., APC, TP53)</span> that results in the slow transformation of adenomas into carcinomas.![[../../assets/img/L29403.jpg|L29403.jpg]]
>[!Mnemonic] 
>This follows the alphabet: <font color="#ffc000">A</font>PC -> <font color="#ffc000">K</font>RAS -> <font color="#ffc000">P</font>53

- Microsatellite instability pathway in colon cancer: due to methylation or mutations in mismatch repair genes (MMR genes, e.g., <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">MLH1 or MSH2</span>), see [[./Lynch syndrome|Lynch syndrome]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">COX-2 overexpression</span>
	- Associated with colorectal cancer
	- Possible protective effect of long-term use of aspirin and other [[../Pharmacology/Non-opioid analgesics|NSAIDs]]

# Clinical features
## Right-sided colon carcinomas
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Large, bulky masses</span> that protrude into the colonic lumen due to the relatively large caliber of the ascending colon
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Occult bleeding or melena</span>
- Manifestations of iron deficiency anemia (due to chronic bleeding)
## Left-sided colon carcinomas
- Often infiltrate the wall of the colon, encircling it and narrowing the lumen
- More likely to cause <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">obstruction</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Changes in bowel habits</span> (size, consistency, frequency) 
- Blood-streaked stools 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Colicky abdominal pain</span> (due to obstruction)
	- Bowel obstruction occurs earlier in left-sided colon carcinomas <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">because the distal colon has a smaller lumen </span>than the proximal colon and contains solid fecal matter.
