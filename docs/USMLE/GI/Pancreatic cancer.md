# Epidemiology
- Age of onset: 60â€“80 years

---
# Etiology
## Exogenous risk factors
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Smoking (strongest risk factor) </span>
	- Considered to be one of the leading causes of pancreatic cancer and associated with an up to 6-fold increase in the risk of developing malignancy.  
- [[./Chronic pancreatitis|Chronic pancreatitis]] (especially when present for more than 20 years)
- High alcohol consumption 
- Type 2 diabetes mellitus
## Endogenous risk factors
- Age > 50 years
- Inherited genetic syndromes (10% of pancreatic cancers)
	- Familial atypical multiple mole melanoma (FAMMM) syndrome
	- Hereditary breast and [[../Reproductive/Ovarian cancer|ovarian cancer]] syndrome (BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations)
	- HNPCC
	- Von-Hippel-Lindau syndrome
	- Neurofibromatosis type 1
	- [[../Endocrine/Multiple endocrine neoplasias|Multiple endocrine neoplasia]] type 1
	- Familial pancreatic carcinoma

# Clinical features
In most cases, there are no early symptoms suggestive of pancreatic cancer.
## Hypercoagulability
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Trousseau syndrome: superficial thrombophlebitis (in 10% of cases)</span>
	- Recurring thrombophlebitis in changing locations (migratory)
	- Red, tender extremities![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231031142843.png|Pasted image 20231031142843.png]]
	- Classically associated with pancreatic cancer
		- The mucin compounds produced by adenocarcinomas have been found to interact with the selectin family of adhesion molecules, leading to thrombocyte activation and aggregation

>[!tip] 
>A thrombosis of unknown origin may be caused by an undiagnosed malignancy (especially pancreatic cancer, but also pulmonary, and prostatic carcinoma, the "3P's").

>[!warning] 
>In the majority of instances, pancreatic cancer is diagnosed in symptomatic patients once it has already spread regionally or distally and is no longer resectable.

# Pathology
## Location
- Pancreatic head: 65% of cases
- Pancreatic body and tail: 15% of cases
- Diffuse: 20% of cases
## Cell origin
- Pancreatic exocrine tumors: originate from pancreatic acini and ducts
	- Most common: ductal adenocarcinoma (95%) 
		- Altered ductal structures
		- Cellular infiltration
		- Adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head is visible originating from the ductal cells, which have an atypical, uneven, multilayered epithelium (green overlay).
