# Epidemiology

# Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Gastrinomas are assumed to arise from endocrine cells of the gut (mostly the duodenum) or the pancreas. </span>
- Most gastrinomas occur sporadically (∼ 75% of cases).
- Some gastrinomas occur in association with [[../Endocrine/Multiple endocrine neoplasias|multiple endocrine neoplasia]] type 1 (MEN 1) (∼ 25% of cases).

# Pathophysiology
- Gastrinomas are neuroendocrine tumors of the GI tract that secrete gastrin. 
- Hypergastrinemia → stimulation of parietal cells → gastric acid hypersecretion, which leads to:
	- [[./Peptic ulcer disease|Peptic ulcer disease]]
	- Inactivation of pancreatic enzymes → diarrhea, [[./Steatorrhea|steatorrhea]] → [[./Malabsorption|malabsorption]]
		- The high volume of gastric acid that is produced <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decreases intestinal pH.</span> <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pancreatic lipases, which require an alkaline environment to function, are inactivated and can no longer emulsify fats.</span> Moreover, gastrin acts directly on the intestine and prevents sodium and water reabsorption, resulting in secretory diarrhea.

# Clinical features
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most patients manifest with recurrent, therapy-resistant [[./Peptic ulcer disease|peptic ulcer disease]]. </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Abdominal pain</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Diarrhea and [[./Steatorrhea|steatorrhea]]</span>
- Dyspeptic symptoms (e.g., heartburn)
- Upper gastrointestinal bleeding 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Weight loss </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Possible symptoms of other endocrine neoplasias.</span> See [[../Endocrine/Multiple endocrine neoplasias|MEN1]]

# Diagnostics
- Fasting serum gastrin (FSG) and gastric pH (initial studies)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Secretin stimulation test</span>
	- Mechanism 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">In healthy individuals, an infusion of secretin inhibits gastrin secretion.</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">In individuals with gastrinoma, secretin infusion causes a dramatic increase in gastrin secretion.</span>
			- Gastrinoma cells have altered receptor signaling that make them respond aberrantly to secretin stimulation.
	- Findings
		- ↑ Serum gastrin by > 120 pg/mL over baseline FSG confirms gastrinoma
- Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)
	- Single duodenal ulcers (most common) or multiple ulcers <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">in atypical locations (e.g., distal duodenum, jejunum) </span>
	- Thick gastric folds
