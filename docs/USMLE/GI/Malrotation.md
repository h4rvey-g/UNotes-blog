# Epidemiology

# Etiology
- Intestinal bands/adhesions 
- Intestinal malrotation: abnormal rotation of the bowel with abnormal fixation of mesentery to the posterior abdominal wall 
- Megacolon

# Pathophysiology

- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ladd's band</span>s, sometimes called bands of Ladd, are fibrous stalks of peritoneal tissue that attach the cecum to the retroperitoneum in the right lower quadrant (RLQ).
- Obstructing Ladd's Bands are associated with malrotation of the intestine, a developmental disorder in which the cecum is found in the right upper quadrant (RUQ), instead of its normal anatomical position in the RLQ.

# Clinical features
- Malrotation: mostly asymptomatic 
- Midgut volvulus
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bilious vomiting with abdominal distension in a neonate/infant </span>
	- Signs of bowel ischemia: hematochezia, hematemesis, hypotension, and tachycardia
