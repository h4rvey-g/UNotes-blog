# Duodenal atresia
- Definitions
	- Duodenal atresia is the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">complete occlusion or absence of the duodenal lumen.</span>
	- Duodenal stenosis is an incomplete obstruction caused by narrowing of the lumen.
- Epidemiology
	- 20–25% of cases are associated with chromosomal abnormalities, especially Down syndrome.
- Pathophysiology
	- Since the development of the duodenum is connected to the growth of the pancreas and the hepatobiliary system, duodenal atresia is also commonly associated with anomalies of these organs.
- Clinical features
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Intrauterine: [[../Reproductive/Polyhydramnios|polyhydramnios]]</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Duodenal stenosis or atresia prevents the fetus from swallowing and passing amniotic fluid.</span>
	- Postpartum
		- Vomiting that is typically bilious
		- Distended upper abdomen and scaphoid lower abdomen
		- Delayed meconium passage
- Diagnostics
	- Prenatal: ultrasound; Postnatal: x-ray
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Double bubble sign</span>
			- Air and fluid build up proximal to the obstruction and are <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">separated by the pyloric sphincter, which resembles two bubbles on imaging, one in the stomach and one in the duodenum.</span> ![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231211111800.png|Pasted image 20231211111800.png]]
			- If present, test for associated anomalies (e.g., karyotyping, microarray)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Gasless distal bowel</span>
# Jejunal atresia
- Definition: absence of the jejunal or ileal lumen
- Etiology
	- Associated with [[../Biochemistry/Cystic fibrosis|cystic fibrosis]]
	- Risk factors: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">maternal smoking and/or use of vasoconstrictive agents (e.g., cocaine, MDMA) during pregnancy</span>
- Pathophysiology: vascular accident in utero (usually a disruption of superior mesenteric artery) → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">ischemic necrosis and reabsorption of the jejunum or ileum</span> → discontinuous bowel → obstruction
- Clinical features: similar to duodenal atresia
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Reproductive/Polyhydramnios|Polyhydramnios]] (intrauterine)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bilious vomiting and upper abdominal distention (postpartum)</span>
- Diagnostics: Abdominal x-ray shows a triple bubble sign (dilated small bowel loops and air-fluid levels; the three bubbles correlate with the distended stomach, duodenum, and jejunum proximal to the obstruction) and gasless colon.
