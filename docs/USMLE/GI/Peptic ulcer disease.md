# Etiology
## Common causes of PUD
The <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">two major contributing factors</span> to the development of PUD are gastrointestinal infection with H. pylori and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Helicobacter pylori infection</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Associated with 40–70% of duodenal ulcers and 25–50% of gastric ulcers</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Chronic NSAID use</span>
>[!tip] 
>Unlike aspirin and other [[../Pharmacology/Non-opioid analgesics|NSAIDS]], [[../Pharmacology/Non-opioid analgesics|acetaminophen]] is believed to be safe for people with ulcers. It is inactivated peripherally. Since it doesn't thin the blood, it doesn't increase the risk of bleeding either.
## Associated risk factors
- Shared risk factors for PUD, [[./Gastroesophageal reflux disease|GERD]] and gastritis (i.e., smoking, heavy alcohol use, glucocorticoids, caffeine)
## Rare causes of PUD
- Acid hypersecretory states
	- [[./Gastrinoma|Zollinger-Ellison syndrome]]

# Pathophysiology
- H. pylori
	- Gastric ulcers
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">H. pylori colonizes the gastric body (corpus)</span>
		- H. pylori secretes urease → conversion of urea to NH3 → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">alkalinization of acidic environment → survival of bacteria in gastric lumen</span>
		- Bacterial colonization and attachment to epithelial cells → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">release of cytotoxins (e.g., cagA toxin) → disruption of the mucosal barrier and damage to underlying cells</span>
	- Duodenal ulcers
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">H. pylori colonizes the gastric antrum</span>, see [[./Stomach histology|Stomach histology]]
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">H. pylori inhibits somatostatin secretion → ↑ gastrin secretion</span> → ↑ H+ secretion → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">excess H+ delivery to the duodenum</span> 
		- Direct spread of H. pylori to the duodenum → inhibition of duodenal HCO3- secretion→ acidification and insufficient neutralization of duodenal contents

# Diagnostics
### Indications for biopsy
- Gastric ulcers
	- Biopsies are recommended in most cases. 
	- Multiple biopsies are recommended.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">From the edge and base of the ulcer</span> (essential to rule out malignancy, which is not uncommon in gastric ulcers)
		- The central part of the ulcer may contain necrotic tissue, fibrin slough, and other debris, which are typically not useful for diagnostic purposes.
	- Multiple biopsies from different areas of the stomach lining, including those not surrounding the ulcer (to test for H. pylori)
- Duodenal ulcers
	- Obtain biopsies from ulcers with endoscopic features that suggest malignancy.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Duodenal ulcers are usually benign and do not require routine biopsy.</span>

# Complications
## Peptic ulcer perforation
- Definition: full-thickness injury and loss of bowel wall integrity that results in leakage of gastrointestinal contents
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The second most common complication of PUD</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">PUD is the most common cause of GI perforation.</span>
- Etiology
	- Prepyloric gastric ulcers are the most common cause of perforation.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Duodenal ulcers of the anterior wall are more likely to perforate than ulcers of the posterior wall. </span>
		- This is because less protection is provided by the surrounding anatomical structures.
- Clinical features
	- Sudden, diffuse abdominal pain and [[../MSK/Spasticity (Clonus) vs Rigidity|rigidity]]
	- Fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension 
	- Pneumoperitoneum
	- Shoulder pain (irritation of the phrenic nerve)
