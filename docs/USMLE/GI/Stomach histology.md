- Upper glandular layer
	- **Parietal Cells**: They are <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">larger</span> and have a distinct, round or <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">triangular</span> shape. Their cytoplasm appears eosinophilic (pinkish) due to the abundance of mitochondria. The nucleus is centrally located and often round.
- Deeper aspect of glands
	- **Chief Cells**: These are <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">smaller, and their shape is more columnar or cuboidal.</span> They have <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">basophilic (blue/purple) cytoplasm</span> because of the high concentration of rough endoplasmic reticulum necessary for enzyme secretion. The nuclei of chief cells are typically basal.
