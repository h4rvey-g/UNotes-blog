### Dumping syndrome
- Definition: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">rapid gastric emptying</span> as a result of defective gastric reservoir function, impaired pyloric emptying mechanisms, or anomalous postsurgery gastric motor function
#### Early dumping
- Pathophysiology: dysfunctional or bypassed pyloric sphincter → rapid emptying of undiluted <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hyperosmolar chyme into the small intestine → fluid shift to the intestinal lumen → small bowel distention → vagal stimulation → increased intestinal motility</span>
- Clinical features
	- Occur within <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">15–30 minutes after meal ingestion</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Include nausea, vomiting, [[./Diarrhea|diarrhea]], and cramps</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Vasomotor symptoms such as sweating, flushing, and palpitations</span>
- Management
	- Dietary modifications: small meals that include a combination of complex carbohydrates and foods rich in protein and fat
#### Late dumping
- Pathophysiology: dysfunctional pyloric sphincter → rapid emptying of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">glucose-containing chyme into the small intestine → quick reabsorption of glucose → hyperglycemia → excessive release of insulin → [[../Endocrine/Hypoglycemia|hypoglycemia]] and release of catecholamines</span>
- Clinical features
	- Occur <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hours after meal ingestion</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Include signs of [[../Endocrine/Hypoglycemia|hypoglycemia]] (e.g., hunger, tremor, lightheadedness)</span>
	- GI discomfort
- Management
	- Dietary modifications
	- Second-line treatment: octreotide
	- Third-line treatment: surgery
