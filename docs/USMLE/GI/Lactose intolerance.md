- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hydrogen breath test</span>
	- The amount of hydrogen in the expired air increases after administering lactose in the fasting state. 
	- Procedure
		- Fasting for 8–12 hours
		- Ingestion of lactose 
		- Measurement of breath hydrogen levels at baseline and at 30‑minute intervals over 3 hours
		- Breath hydrogen levels > 20 ppm are considered diagnostic of lactose intolerance.
- Stool analysis
	- ↑ [[./Stool osmotic gap|Stool osmotic gap]] 
	- ↓ Stool pH (< 6): due to lactose fermentation by colonic bacterial flora

# Treatment
