# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- Biliary pancreatitis (∼ 40% of cases; mostly caused by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[./Gallstones|gallstones]]</span>) 
	- Blockage of the common bile duct and pancreatic duct
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Alcohol-induced</span> (∼ 20% of cases)
- Idiopathic (∼ 25% of cases)

# Pathophysiology

# Clinical features
## Symptoms
- Constant, severe epigastric pain
	- Classically radiating towards the back
	- Worse after meals and when supine
	- Improves on leaning forwards
- Nausea, vomiting
- Fever
## Examination findings
- General
	- Signs of shock: tachycardia, hypotension, oliguria/anuria
		- Due to distributive shock from cytokine release, and third-spacing of intravascular fluid.
	- Abdominal examination
- Abdominal tenderness, distention, guarding 
	- Ileus with reduced bowel sounds and tympany on percussion
	- Ascites
	- Skin changes (rare) 
		- Cullen sign: periumbilical ecchymosis and discoloration (bluish-red) ![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231004171430.png|Pasted image 20231004171430.png]]
		- Grey Turner sign: flank ecchymosis with discoloration ![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231004171443.png|Pasted image 20231004171443.png]]
		- Fox sign: ecchymosis over the inguinal ligament

>Circulating pancreatic enzymes cause swelling of the subcutaneous tissue and localized hemorrhages. These signs, though nonspecific, suggest retroperitoneal bleeding and are associated with a poor prognosis.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pulmonary examination: signs of [[../Blood/Pleural effusion|pleural effusion]] and/or [[../Respiratory/Acute respiratory distress syndrome|ARDS]] may be present</span>
	- Pancreatitis is a major risk factor for [[../Respiratory/Acute respiratory distress syndrome|ARDS]] as it results in the release of large amounts of inflammatory cytokines and pancreatic enzymes into the circulation, which leads to infiltration of neutrophils into the pulmonary interstitium and alveolar spaces.

>[!tip] 
>As the pancreas is a retroperitoneal organ, abdominal guarding may not be present with the typical hard rigidity seen in inflammation of intraperitoneal organs. Instead, the abdomen is distended and elastic on palpation.

# Diagnostics
## Diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis
Two of the three following criteria should be met for a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis to be made. 
- Characteristic abdominal pain
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Serum pancreatic enzymes: lipase or amylase ≥ 3× ULN</span>
- Characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis on cross-sectional imaging (e.g., contrast-enhanced CT abdomen)
