# Etiology
---
- PBC is considered an autoimmune disease
- Often associated with other autoimmune conditions, e.g.: 
	- CREST syndrome
	- Sicca syndrome
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Autoimmune thyroid disease, especially [[../Endocrine/Hashimoto thyroiditis|Hashimoto thyroiditis]]</span>
	- [[./Celiac disease|Celiac disease]]
	- [[../MSK/Rheumatoid arthritis|Rheumatoid arthritis]]
# Pathophysiology
Inflammation and progressive destruction (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">likely due to an autoimmune reaction</span>) of the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">small and medium-sized intrahepatic bile ducts (progressive ductopenia)</span> → defective bile duct regeneration → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">chronic cholestasis</span> → secondary hepatocyte damage due to increased concentration of toxins that typically get excreted via bile → gradual portal and periportal fibrotic changes → liver failure → liver [[./Cirrhosis|cirrhosis]] and portal hypertension (in advanced stage)

# Diagnostics
---
- Liver chemistries: cholestatic pattern of injury
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ ALP, ↑ GGT, ↑ direct bilirubin</span>
	- Mild transaminitis (or <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">normal AST and ALT</span>)
# Treatment
## General principles
- Start pharmacotherapy with ursodeoxycholic acid for all patients.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Offer supportive care, including management of cholestasis-associated pruritus.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Liver transplantation is necessary if liver [[./Cirrhosis|cirrhosis]] is advanced.</span>
## Pharmacotherapy
- First-line: ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA, ursodiol): a hydrophilic, nontoxic bile acid with immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, choleretic, and cytoprotective effects
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Slows disease progression</span> and development of complications (e.g., esophageal varices)
	- Prolongs transplant-free and overall survival
	- Also used in [[./Primary sclerosing cholangitis|primary sclerosing cholangitis]], cholestasis of pregnancy, and small cholesterol stones
