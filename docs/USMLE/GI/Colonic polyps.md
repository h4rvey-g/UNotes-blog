# Adenomatous polyps
- High malignant potential![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231215205130.png|Pasted image 20231215205130.png]]
	- Tubular adenoma: < 5%![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231031135152.png|Pasted image 20231031135152.png]]
	- Tubulovillous adenoma: ∼ 20%
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Villous adenoma: ∼ 50%</span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231031112847.png|Pasted image 20231031112847.png]]

# Hamartomatous polyposis syndromes
## Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS)
- Inheritance: autosomal dominant
- Intestinal manifestations
	- Large polyps can manifest with abdominal pain, GI bleeding, or intestinal obstruction.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lifetime [[./Colorectal cancer|colorectal cancer]] risk: ∼ 40% (onset typically occurs at ∼ 45 years of age) and increased risk of other GI malignancies (e.g., small bowel, pancreatic, stomach cancer)</span> 
- Extraintestinal manifestations
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Mucocutaneous hyperpigmented macules (i.e., lentigines) on the lips, buccal mucosa, genitals, palms, soles (seen in 95% of patients)</span> ![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231031103738.png|Pasted image 20231031103738.png]]
		- Due to affecting melanocytes, leading to the overproduction of melanin and the development of hyperpigmented macules.
	- Increased risk of non-GI tract cancers (e.g., breast cancer, [[../Reproductive/Ovarian cancer|ovarian cancer]])
- Endoscopy and histology: hamartomatous PJS polyps throughout the GI tract
	- PJS polyps are hamartomatous, with mucin-filled cystic spaces and significant smooth muscle proliferation.
