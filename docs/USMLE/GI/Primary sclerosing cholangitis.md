# Epidemiology
- Sex: ♂ > ♀ (2:1)
- Age: The median age at diagnosis is ∼ 40.

>[!tip] 
>Compared with [[./Primary biliary cholangitis|Primary biliary cholangitis]], which are common among middle-aged women.

# Etiology
- The exact cause is unknown.
- Associations
	- Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)
		- ∼ 90% of patients with PSC have IBD (approx. 87% of these patients have [[./Ulcerative colitis|ulcerative colitis]])
	- Presence of HLA-B8 and HLA-DR3
 
 >[!tip] 
>The majority of patients with PSC also have [[./Ulcerative colitis|ulcerative colitis]].

# Pathophysiology
Progressive chronic inflammation of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">both intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts</span>

# Clinical features
- Signs of cholestasis
	- Jaundice/scleral icterus
	- Pruritus
	- Pale stool, dark urine
	- Fatigue
	- Can lead to acute cholangitis (fever, chills, right upper quadrant pain)
- Later stages: signs of [[./Cirrhosis|cirrhosis]]
	- Hepatosplenomegaly
	- Portal hypertension
	- Liver failure
- Symptoms of chronic inflammatory bowel disease, which is frequently associated with PSC, or other associated comorbidities

---
# Diagnostics
- Cholestatic enzymes
	- ↑ [[../Blood/Alkaline phosphatase|ALP]]
	- ↑ GGT
	- Normal or ↑ conjugated bilirubin 
- Transaminases: normal or moderately elevated (approx. 2–3× ULN) AST and ALT  
- Lipid profile: ↑ total cholesterol

>[!Mnemonic] 
>Suspect PSC in patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease and elevated cholestatic enzymes ([[../Blood/Alkaline phosphatase|ALP]], GGT, and conjugated bilirubin).

- Typical perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">pANCA</span>): present in up to 80% of patients with PSC.
## Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography 
- Method of choice (if there is no biliary obstruction)
- Supportive findings: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">multifocal intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct strictures alternating with dilatation and beading of bile ducts</span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231017161356.png|Pasted image 20231017161356.png]]There is irregular dilatation (green overlay) of intrahepatic bile ducts proximal to a common duct stenosis (arrow). Alternation of strictured and dilated segments creates a beaded appearance. Peripheral ducts appear pruned as a result of obliteration (examples indicated by arrowheads), and scattered biliary diverticula are seen (example indicated by red overlay).

- Cholangiocarcinoma (∼ 10–15% of cases)
