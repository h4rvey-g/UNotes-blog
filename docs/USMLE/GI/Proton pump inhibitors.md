# Adverse effects
The resultant increase in gastric pH leads to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased gastrin formation</span>, which, over time, can lead to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hypertrophy of ECL and parietal cells</span>.  After chronic use (eg, >8 weeks), <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">abrupt cessation of the PPI can trigger rebound gastric acid hypersecretion by the hyperfunctioning parietal cells, leading to reflux symptoms; PPIs can be slowly tapered to prevent this adverse effect.</span>
