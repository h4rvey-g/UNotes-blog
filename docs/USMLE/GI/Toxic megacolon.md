# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- Bacterial: [[../Infective disease/Clostridium difficile infection|C. difficile]] (pseudomembranous colitis), Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter infections
- Inflammatory colitis: [[./Ulcerative colitis|Ulcerative colitis]], [[./Crohn disease|Crohn disease]]

---
# Pathophysiology
- Colonic accumulation of inflammatory mediators and bacteria → nitric oxide synthesis → colonic dilation
- Edema and inflammation of the colonic smooth muscle → colonic dysmotility → colonic dilation

---
# Clinical features
- (Bloody) [[./Diarrhea|diarrhea]] and vomiting
- Abdominal distention and pain
- Signs of sepsis (fever, tachycardia, hypotension) and dehydration

---
# Diagnostics
- Abdominal x-ray findings 
	- Dilation of the colon (transverse colon diameter > 6 cm)
	- Loss of haustration 
	- Multiple air-fluid levels![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230919160024.png|Pasted image 20230919160024.png]]

>[!warning] 
>Colonoscopy should be avoided in patients with suspected toxic megacolon since it increases the risk of colonic perforation.
