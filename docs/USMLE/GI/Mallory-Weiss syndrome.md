- May be asymptomatic
- Epigastric or back pain

# Diagnostics
## EGD
- Typical findings 
	- Often <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">a single longitudinal tear (but multiple tears are possible) in the mucosa at the gastroesophageal junction</span> or in the cardia of the stomach which are limited to the mucosa and submucosa
	- A fibrin crust over the split, a clot, or active bleeding may be evident.![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231018170927.png|Pasted image 20231018170927.png]]
