- Blood tests: macrocytic and/or microcytic anemia; ↓ electrolytes, ↓ total protein, vitamin deficiencies
- D-xylose absorption test: assesses the absorptive function of the upper small intestine
	- Because absorption of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">D-xylose in the intestine does not rely on the breakdown by pancreatic enzymes</span>, a normal increase in urinary D-xylose excretion indicates a healthy intestinal mucosa. In conditions associated with damage to the intestinal mucosa, oral administration of D-xylose will result in increased fecal D-xylose excretion.
- Hydrogen breath test: assess the intestinal absorption of individual carbohydrates
- Further testing (for underlying diseases): e.g., [[./Celiac disease|celiac disease]] or [[./Lactose intolerance|lactose intolerance]]
