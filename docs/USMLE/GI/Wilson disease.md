- Early-stage Wilson disease is characterized by the presence of copper deposits in the liver. 
- As the disease progresses, copper accumulates in other organs as well, most importantly in the brain and cornea.
# Epidemiology

# Etiology


---
# Pathophysiology
- Autosomal recessive mutations in the ATP7B gene (Wilson gene) on chromosome 13, which encodes for a membrane-bound, copper-transporting ATPase → defective ATP7B protein
	- Reduced incorporation of copper into apoceruloplasmin  → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ serum ceruloplasmin (The major carrier of copper in the blood and an important enzyme with ferroxidase activity.)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Reduced biliary copper excretion</span> 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Results in ↑ free serum copper → accumulation in the liver, cornea, CNS (basal ganglia, brain stem, cerebellum), kidneys, and enterocytes</span>

# Treatment
## General principles
- Encourage a low-copper diet (e.g., avoidance of organ meats, shellfish, nuts, chocolate, copper-containing dietary supplements).
- Refer patients with refractory decompensated [[./Cirrhosis|cirrhosis]] or acute liver failure for liver transplantation.
## Pharmacological therapy
- First line: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">chelating agents, e.g., penicillamine (preferred)</span> or trientine
	- Chelating agents facilitate renal excretion of copper by forming water-soluble compounds.
- Maintenance therapy: reduced-dose zinc salts or a chelating agent
