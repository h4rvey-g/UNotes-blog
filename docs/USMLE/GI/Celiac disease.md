# Etiology
- Genetic predisposition with association to HLA antigens
	- [[../Immunology/HLA system|HLA-DQ2]] in 90–95% of patients
	- [[../Immunology/HLA system|HLA-DQ8]] in 5–10% of patients
- Consuming gliadin from grains such as wheat, rye, and barley leads to an autoimmune reaction within the small intestinal wall.

---
# Pathophysiology
- Symptoms manifest when a genetically predisposed individual develops an immunological response to gliadin, an alcohol-soluble fraction of gluten.
- Consumption of food containing gluten → tissue transglutaminase is released  → modifies gliadin from gluten proteins → pathogenic T cells react to and are activated by modified gliadin → mediate chronic intestinal inflammation → epithelial damage resulting in villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and loss of brush border → impaired resorption of nutrients in the small intestine (especially in the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum) → [[./Malabsorption|malabsorption]] symptoms

# Clinical features
## Gastrointestinal symptoms
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Chronic or recurring [[./Diarrhea|diarrhea]]: [[./Steatorrhea|steatorrhea]]</span>
- Flatulence, abdominal bloating, and pain
## Extraintestinal symptoms and associations
- **[[./Malabsorption|Malabsorption]] symptoms**: fatigue, weight loss, vitamin deficiency, iron deficiency [[../Blood/Anemia|anemia]], [[../MSK/Osteoporosis|osteoporosis]], hypocalcemia
- In children: failure to thrive, growth failure, delayed puberty, secondary [[../Endocrine/Hyperparathyroidism|hyperparathyroidism]]
- Dermatologic associations: **[[../MSK/Dermatitis herpetiformis|dermatitis herpetiformis]]**
	- Transglutaminases play a role in forming extensively cross-linked proteins (e.g., elastin, coagulation by factor XIII).
- Neuropsychiatric symptoms: peripheral neuropathies (numbness, burning and tingling of the hands and feet) , headache, ataxia, depression, irritability

# Diagnostics
## Laboratory studies
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">IgA tissue transglutaminase antibody (tTG IgA): initial test</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Total IgA</span>
	- Indicated for all patients because of the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">high prevalence of [[../Immunology/Selective IgA deficiency|IgA deficiency]] in patients with celiac disease</span> (approx. 2–3%)
	- If patients have low IgA, perform further IgG-based testing.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Deamidated gliadin peptide</span>
	- IgG-based testing: indicated in [[../Immunology/Selective IgA deficiency|IgA deficiency]] or discordant biopsy and serology
		- IgG-tissue transglutaminase (tTG IgG)
		- IgG deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP IgG)
	- IgA-based testing: IgA deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP IgA)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anti-endomysial antibody (EMA): Potential second-line confirmatory test (high-specificity)</span>
## Endoscopy
- EGD with small intestine biopsy (confirmatory test)
	- Intraepithelial lymphocytic infiltration
	- Crypt hyperplasia
	- Villous atrophy

---
# Treatment
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Strict, lifelong gluten-free diet </span>
	- Abstain from products containing wheat, rye, barley, or spelt.
	- Symptoms usually improve quickly
