# Subtypes and variants
## Presbycusis
- Definition: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">age-related, sensorineural hearing loss</span>
- Pathophysiology: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">progressive and irreversible damage of the hair cells of the organ of Corti (especially near the basal turn of the cochlea) that impairs high-frequency hearing</span>
- Epidemiology
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most common cause of sensorineural hearing loss</span>
	- Age 75: > 50%
	- Age 90: nearly 100%
- Clinical features
	- Progressive bilateral hearing loss, particularly of higher frequencies (using a low-pitched and clear voice to speak with older patients can improve communication)
	- Difficulty hearing in noisy, crowded environments.
	- Can cause depression and/or isolation
