# Clinical features
## Motor signs
- Parkinsonism
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bradykinesia</span>: slowed movements in combination with decreased amplitude/speed when moving 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Resting tremor</span> (4–6 Hz)
		- Oftentimes the presenting symptom
		- Pill-rolling tremor that subsides with voluntary movements but increases with stress
	- [[../MSK/Spasticity (Clonus) vs Rigidity|Rigidity]]: increased and persistent resistance to passive joint movement that is independent of speed
		- Cogwheel rigidity
- Postural instability 
	- Imbalance and tendency to fall
- Parkinsonian gait: shuffling gait with quickened and shortened steps

# Diagnostics
## Pathology
- Lewy bodies
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Aggregates of misfolded α-synuclein and other proteins</span>, such as ubiquitin and neurofilament protein within the neural cell bodies
	- Appear histologically as <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">intracellular hyaline eosinophilic globules</span>
	- May be found in brainstem, substantia nigra, and cortex
	- Also seen in Lewy body [[./Dementia|dementia]]

- Image A: An eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion (Lewy body; blue overlay) is visible inside a neuron. There is a large accumulation of neuromelanin (brown granules; green overlay).
- Image B: A neurite staining positive for α-synuclein is visible in the center of the image (Lewy neurite; yellow overlay).

# Treatment
## Nonergot [[./Neurotransmitters|dopamine]] receptor agonists
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pramipexole</span>, Ropinirole, Apomorphine
- Consider as initial treatment in younger patients, especially those with risk factors for levodopa-induced dyskinesia.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Some patients develop impulse control disorders with compulsive gambling or hypersexuality.</span>
>[!tip] 
><span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ergot dopamine agonists (cabergoline and bromocriptine)</span> are not recommended in Parkinson disease or restless leg syndrome, but are<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> first-line treatment in [[../Endocrine/Pituitary adenoma|Prolactinoma]] and [[../Endocrine/Hyperprolactinemia|Hyperprolactinemia]].</span>
## Anticholinergic drugs ([[../Pharmacology/Muscarinic antagonists|muscarinic antagonists]])
- Benztropine, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Trihexyphenidyl</span>, Biperiden
- Beneficial regarding tremor and rigidity but does not improve bradykinesia

# Parkinson-plus syndromes
## [[./Dementia|Dementia]] with Lewy bodies
- Epidemiology
	- Second most common form of neurodegenerative [[./Dementia|dementia]] (10–20% of [[./Dementia|dementia]] cases) 
- Diagnosis requires two of the following
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cognitive fluctuations</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Visual hallucinations</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Parkinsonism</span>
