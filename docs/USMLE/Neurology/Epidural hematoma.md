# Epidemiology
---


# Etiology
---
## Inciting event
- Traumatic EDH
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Head injury (most common</span>; e.g., due to motor vehicle accidents, falls, assault)
## Source of hemorrhage
- Arterial EDH
	- Source: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">middle meningeal artery rupture or tear</span> (a branch of the maxillary artery and the most common source of hemorrhage in EDH)
	- Sites of rupture 
		- Pterion (most common): the thinnest part of the skull and a site at which the middle meningeal artery lies in close proximity to the skull

- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Venous shunting of blood out from the epidural space and initial asymptomatic compression of the anterior temporal lobe → lucid interval</span>
- Continued expansion of EDH → increased intracranial pressure → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">transtentorial uncal herniation</span> (Monro-Kellie principle) which leads to: 
	- Compression of the ipsilateral [[./Oculomotor nerve palsy (III)|oculomotor nerve]] and loss of parasympathetic supply to the pupillary sphincter → ipsilateral dilated pupil (anisocoria)
	- Compression of the brain stem → rapid neurological decline, Cushing triad
# Clinical features
---
- Classic presentation of EDH
	1. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Initial loss of consciousness immediately following a head injury</span>
	2. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Temporary recovery of consciousness with return to normal or near-normal neurological function (lucid interval)</span>
	3. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Renewed decline in neurological status and onset of symptoms caused by hematoma expansion and mass effect</span>: 
		- Contralateral focal neurological deficits 
		- Signs of ↑ ICP (e.g., headache, Cushing triad) 
		- Pupillary abnormalities (sign of uncal herniation) 
			- Anisocoria with ipsilateral mydriasis (most common)
			- Unilateral or bilateral fixed dilated pupils
			- Potentially contralateral or bilateral mydriasis
		- Signs of cerebral herniation syndromes
