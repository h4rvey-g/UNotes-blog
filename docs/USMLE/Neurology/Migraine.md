# Pathophysiology
- Activation of meningeal nociceptors
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dilatation of intracranial blood vessels</span> → activation of meningeal nociceptors 
	- Activation of the trigeminovascular pathway: activation of trigeminal neurons → release of vasoactive neuropeptides such as substance P
- Dysregulation of pain sensitization in the trigeminal system (CN V): cortical spreading depression → dysregulation of trigeminovascular neurons → neurogenic inflammation → hypersensitization → nausea, loss of appetite, yawning, fatigue, anxiety, depression
- Activation of the autonomic nervous system: external physiological and emotional stimulation (e.g., hormonal changes, stress) → hypothalamic response to the change in homeostasis → hypothalamic neurons influence the autonomic nervous system → shift toward a parasympathetic tone → constriction and dilatation of intracranial, especially the meningeal, blood vessels

# Treatment
## Abortive therapy for migraines
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Treat nausea and vomiting, if present.</span> 
	- Accompanying vomiting makes absorption of oral medications (e.g., oral NSAIDs) unreliable.
	- IV fluids
	- Parenteral antiemetics: e.g., metoclopramide, prochlorperazine
### Mild to moderate headache
- First-line treatment consists of NSAIDs, [[../Pharmacology/Non-opioid analgesics|acetaminophen]], acetylsalicylic acid, or combinations including caffeine.
### Moderate to severe headache
- Parenteral antidopaminergics
	- Metoclopramide
	- Prochlorperazine PLUS diphenhydramine
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Migraine-specific agents: triptans (e.g., sumatriptan) OR ergotamine; do not combine these agents!</span>
	- Triptans
		- Sumatriptan
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists</span> that cause:
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Vasoconstriction of (dilated) cranial and basilar arteries</span>
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Inhibition of trigeminal nerve nociception</span>
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Inhibition of vasoactive peptide secretion</span>
		- Adverse effects
			- Vasospasm of coronary vessels → coronary ischemia (rare)
			- Paresthesia and sensation of cold in the extremities
			- [[./Serotonin syndrome|Serotonin syndrome]] (if taken with other 5-HT agonists)
## Prophylactic therapy of migraine
- Lifestyle modifications
	- Exercise in moderation
	- Maintain a healthy diet
	- Identify and try to avoid potential triggers
	- Follow a regular sleeping schedule
- General prophylaxis
	- First-line
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anticonvulsants (e.g., topiramate, divalproex)</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Beta blockers</span> (e.g., propranolol, metoprolol (off-label), timolol)
	- Second-line
		- Tricyclic antidepressant: amitriptyline
		- NSAIDs
