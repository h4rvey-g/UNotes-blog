# Pathophysiology
- ↑ ADH secretion → receptor-mediated signaling cascade in the distal convoluted tubules and the collecting ducts of the kidneys → build-up of additional water canals (aquaporin-2) in the luminal cell membrane
- Water is drawn out of the urine and into the hyperosmolar kidney tissue → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">concentration of urine and ↑ [[../Renal/Urine osmolality|Urine osmolality]]</span> (becomes higher than serum osmolality)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Water retention → ↓ serum osmolality with transient volume expansion → ↑ ANP, ↑ BNP, and ↓ aldosterone → ↑ urinary sodium and water excretion → euvolemic hyponatremia</span>
- Osmotic fluid shifts → cerebral edema and ↑ intracranial pressure (may occur in patients with extremely low Na<sup>+</sup> levels)

# Clinical features
## Symptoms of hyponatremia
- Mild
	- Anorexia
	- Nausea, vomiting
	- Headache
	- Muscle cramps
- Moderate
	- Muscle weakness
	- Lethargy
	- Confusion
- Severe 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Seizures</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Altered consciousness</span>

>[!tip] 
><span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Both SIADH and [[../Endocrine/Primary hyperaldosteronism|Primary hyperaldosteronism]] have no edema.</span> A hyponatremic patient with edema should raise suspicion for other conditions (e.g. [[../Cardiology/Congestive heart failure|congestive heart failure]]).
