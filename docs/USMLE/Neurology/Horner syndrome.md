# Clinical features
- Triad of Horner syndrome 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Miosis (constriction of the pupil)</span>
		- Occurs because the sympathetically controlled iris dilator muscle fails to contract. See [[./Pupillary light reflex|Pupillary light reflex]].
		- Leads to anisocoria and a dilation lag on exam
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">More noticeable in the dark when the sympathetic tone is increased</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Partial ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid)</span>
		- Occurs because the sympathetically controlled superior tarsal muscle fails to keep the upper eyelid raised
		- It is milder than ptosis associated with [[./Oculomotor nerve palsy (III)|oculomotor nerve]] or levator palpebrae muscle lesions.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anhidrosis (absence of sweating) or reduced sweating on the face and arm, depending on the location of the lesion</span>
		- Occurs because the sympathetic innervation of the facial sweat glands is impaired
		- Seen in central and preganglionic lesions 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Facial flushing due to vasodilatation</span> 
	- Occurs because the vasoconstrictive effect of the sympathetic nervous system is lost.
- (Apparent) enophthalmos 
- Associated symptoms depending on the etiology:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Atrophy of arm and hand muscles </span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Infiltration of the brachial plexus</span> causes pain (plexus neuralgia), as well as motor and sensory deficits in the arm.
	- Pain in the neck or face
