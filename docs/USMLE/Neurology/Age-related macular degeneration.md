# Epidemiology
- AMD is the leading cause of blindness in individuals > 65 years in developed countries.
	- Age of onset: usually > 55 years

---
# Etiology
- Risk factors
	- Advanced age
	- Cardiovascular disease 
	- Smoking

---
# Pathophysiology
AMD is characterized by progressive degenerative changes in the central part of the retina (macula) → visual impairment. 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dry AMD (∼ 90%)</span>
	- Also referred to as nonexudative AMD or atrophic AMD
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Deposition of yellow-whitish material consisting of lipids, vitronectin, and other proteins (drusen) in the retinal pigment epithelium and between it and Bruch membrane  → slow progressive atrophy of the local retinal pigment epithelium (centrally or pericentrally)</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Wet AMD (∼ 10%)</span>
	- Also referred to as exudative AMD or neovascular AMD
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Choroidal neovascularization (between the retinal pigment epithelium and Bruch's membrane) → leaking of intravascular serous fluid and blood  → sudden localized elevation of the macula and/or detachment of the retinal pigment epithelium</span>
		- Hemorrhages can cause sudden loss of vision.

# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Painless central or pericentral visual impairment → reduced visual acuity, difficulty adapting to changes in lighting </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dry AMD: slow progressive visual impairment (usually over decades) and unilateral or bilateral onset </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Wet AMD: acute or insidious onset (over weeks to months) and usually manifests in one eye first </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Metamorphopsia: type of visual distortion in which straight lines appear wavy</span>, which can be tested for using an Amsler grid 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Scotoma (blind spot) </span>

---
# Diagnostics
- Amsler grid: detection of metamorphopsias and scotomas 
- Fundoscopy
	- Dry AMD
		- Drusen ![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240114102754.png|Pasted image 20240114102754.png]]
	- Wet AMD
		- Subretinal and intraretinal hemorrhage and/or exudate![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240114102843.png|Pasted image 20240114102843.png]]

# Treatment
- Treatment of wet AMD
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">First-line: injection of VEGF inhibitors (ranibizumab, bevacizumab, pegaptanib) into the vitreous body </span>
