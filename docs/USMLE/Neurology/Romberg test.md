# Purpose
Used to distinguish between sensory and cerebellar ataxia
# Examination
The patient is asked to stand with both feet together, raise the arms, and close the eyes.
# Interpretation
- Positive Romberg
	- The patient's coordination is impaired when the eyes are closed and the patient starts swaying or swaying increases
	- Indicates sensory ataxia 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">To remain standing, patients require two of the following: proprioception, vision, and vestibular function.</span>
		- A patient with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">absent proprioception (dorsal column damage)</span> will lose balance upon closing their eyes because they are left with only vestibular function.
	- An increased tendency to fall sideways after closing the eyes can also indicate a vestibular disorder. In the case of a unilateral vestibular disorder, the patient usually falls towards the side of the lesion. 
- Negative Romberg
	- Closing the eyes does not affect the patient's balance (i.e., swaying does not increase).
	- Uncontrollable swaying, even with the eyes open, is indicative of cerebellar ataxia.
