# Epidemiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Opioid overdose is the most common cause of [[../Psychiatry/Psychoactive drug intoxication and withdrawal|drug overdose]] death.</span>

# Etiology


---
# Indications
---
## Pain management
- Buprenorphine
	- Partial μ-agonist
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Chronic pain refractory to nonopioid analgesics: transdermal patches</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Management of opioid use disorder</span> (sublingual and subcutaneous preparations)
	- Other features
		- Can displace other opioids from opioid receptors due to high receptor affinity and precipitate withdrawal since it does not produce the same receptor activation as a full agonist
		- High doses of naloxone or naltrexone are necessary to antagonize buprenorphine effects.

# Clinical features
## Opioid toxidrome
![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240315214152.png|Pasted image 20240315214152.png]]
The classic triad consists of:
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Altered mental status (e.g., CNS depression, euphoria)</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bilateral miosis (pinpoint pupils)</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Opioid-induced respiratory depression</span>
>[!warning] 
><span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The absence of miosis does not rule out opioid overdose</span> as hypoxia, co-ingested drugs (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines), and/or medications (e.g., atropine) may cause mydriasis, thereby counteracting the miotic effect of opioids.
## <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD)</span>
- ↓ Respiratory rate and/or apnea
- ↓ Tidal volume
>[!warning] 
>OIRD is the most common cause of death from opioid overdose and is treated with naloxone for opioid overdose.
## Other clinical features

# Diagnostics

# Treatment
>[!tip] 
>Naloxone has short half-life (60 minutes on average; ranges from 30 to 90 minutes). Therefore, patients may develop recurrent symptoms of opioid toxicity after naloxone is metabolized, and frequent redosing may be necessary.
