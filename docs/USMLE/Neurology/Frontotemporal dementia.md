# Epidemiology
- Age of onset: usually between 40 and 60 years <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">(typically younger than in [[../Psychiatry/Alzheimer disease|Alzheimer disease]])</span>

---
# Etiology
- Generally associated with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">pathological intracellular inclusion bodies (Pick bodies) that are caused by mutations in tau (main protein component of Pick bodies) or progranulin (precursor of granulin, which regulates cell growth) proteins</span>

# Pathophysiology


---
# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Early changes in personality and behavior → inability to observe social etiquette</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Apathy</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Disinhibited behavior</span>
		- A pattern of socially inappropriate and often impulsive behavior that is seen in several neurological disorders
		- Examples include <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">offensive language and inappropriate touching.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Changes in cognitive functioning</span>
	- [[./Aphasia|Aphasia]] (but no apraxia)
	- Intelligence, orientation, and memory initially intact
- Motor deficits
	- Parkinsonism (in later stages)

>[!tip] 
>Patients with FTD display changes of personality and social behavior, but their memory generally remains intact.

# Diagnostics
## Pathology
- Detection of different types of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">intracellular inclusions</span> in surviving neurons (tau or TDP-43 in approx. 90% of cases)
	- Pick bodies (FTLD-tau): round cytoplasmic inclusions of aggregated hyperphosphorylated <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">tau proteins </span>
	- FTLD‑TDP: inclusions with ubiquitinated TDP‑43
