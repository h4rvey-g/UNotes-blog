- Topical ophthalmic therapy. Administer the following eye drops in succession, one minute apart: 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Direct parasympathomimetic: pilocarpine </span>
	- Alpha-2 agonist: apraclonidine
	- [[../Cardiology/Beta blockers|Beta blocker]]: timolol 
- PLUS a systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor
	- Acetazolamide

## Diagnostics
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Slit-lamp examination of the anterior segment: normal appearing anterior chamber angle</span>
- Tonometry
	- To measure IOP (standard values range between 10â€“21 mm Hg)
- Gonioscopy: to rule out angle-closure glaucoma
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fundoscopy: cupping and pallor of optic disc</span>, disc hemorrhage, diffuse or focal narrowing of the optic disc rim![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240311165723.png|Pasted image 20240311165723.png]]![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240311165743.png|Pasted image 20240311165743.png]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Optic nerve fibers are outside of optic cup in the optic disk. So when nerve fibers are ischemic and lost, the optic cup increases in size.</span>
## Treatment of open-angle glaucoma
Topical prostaglandins are most effective and usually used initially; other drugs (with a different mechanism) may be added if topical prostaglandins are unsuccessful.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Preferred first-line therapy: topical prostaglandin analogs </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Latanoprost</span>
