# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Mostly asymptomatic </span>

# Diagnostics

# Pathology
## Microscopic findings
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Mesenchymal origin (arachnoid cap cells)</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Whorls of meningothelial cells (onion peel arrangement)</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Psammoma bodies</span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231224160212.png|Pasted image 20231224160212.png]]Two of these whorls have a deeply basophilic acellular core, known as a psammoma body, which indicates dystrophic calcification.
