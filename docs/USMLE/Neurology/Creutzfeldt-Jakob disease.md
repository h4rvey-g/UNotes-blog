# Epidemiology

# Etiology
CJD is caused by misfolded proteins (prions, PrP<sup>Sc</sup>) that are either produced by affected individual themselves, or taken up from an exogenous source.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sporadic (∼ 85%):</span> no identifiable source
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Familial (∼ 10–15%)</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Acquired (&lt; 1%) </span>
	- Iatrogenic CJD: transmission during medical procedures, such as:
		- Brain surgery (surgical equipment)
		- Organ transplantation (e.g., corneal transplant)
		- Blood [[../Blood/Transfusion|transfusion]]
	- Variant CJD (vCJD)
		- Occurs due to ingestion of beef infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)
		- BSE is a transmissible prion disease occurring in cattle also known as “mad cow disease”

# Pathophysiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Conversion of normal cellular prion proteins with alpha-helical structure (PrPc) to prions that demonstrate an increase in beta-pleated sheet structure (PrPSc) → conformational change of physiological PrPc  → PrPSc accumulation and plaque formation → neuronal cell death → progression to spongiform encephalopathy </span>
	- Conformational change is triggered via misfolded PrPSc (from scrapie, a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy of sheep)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Since misfolded prions are insoluble, they deposit as plaques resistant to proteases and standard autoclaving, thus contributing to the formation of more PrPSc.</span>

# Clinical features
- Neurological symptoms
	- Cerebellar disturbances (e.g., [[./Gait|gait]] instability) and extrapyramidal deficits
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Myoclonus</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Often triggered by startling (e.g., loud noises)</span>
		- Also associated with metabolic abnormalities found in liver and renal failure
	- Ataxia
- Neuropsychiatric symptoms
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Rapidly progressing [[./Dementia|dementia]] (weeks to months)</span>
	- Personality changes
	- Akinetic mutism

>[!tip] 
>Rapidly progressive [[./Dementia|dementia]] and myoclonic jerks are the hallmarks of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

# Diagnostics
- CSF analysis
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ 14-3-3 protein</span>
- Brain biopsy
	- Diagnosis can only be confirmed by biopsy/autopsy and subsequent neuropathological examination. 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Microscopic findings include spongiform degeneration</span> (e.g., intracytoplasmic vacuoles within the neurons of cerebral and cerebellar cortex that can be seen on H&E)![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231226084740.png|Pasted image 20231226084740.png]]
