>[!tip] Key points
>- Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">chronic degenerative disease of the CNS characterized by demyelination and axonal degeneration in the brain and spinal cord, which are caused by an immune-mediated inflammatory process.</span>
>- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Impaired vision (due to retrobulbar neuritis) is usually the first manifestation of MS</span>; other neurological deficits appear as the disease progresses. The most common clinical course is characterized by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">exacerbations followed by periods of complete or incomplete remission.</span>
# Epidemiology
- Sex: ♀ > ♂ (3:1)
- Age of onset: 20–40 years of age
- Ethnicity: ↑ prevalence among the white and black population
- Prevalence: 50-300 per 100 000 people (greater among people who live further from the equator)

---
# Etiology
The etiology of multiple sclerosis is unclear; it is believed to develop in genetically predisposed people who have been exposed to certain environmental factors.
- Environmental risk factors
	- Low vitamin D levels (insufficient intake, decreased exposure to UV radiation)

# Pathophysiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pathophysiology of MS is characterized by autoimmune inflammation, demyelination, and axonal degeneration.</span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231223165929.png|Pasted image 20231223165929.png]]
- Most commonly accepted theory: Activation of autoreactive T-lymphocytes  → inflammatory processes → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">focal demyelination</span> with partial preservation of axons (acute plaques) → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">loss of axons and atrophy of oligodendrocytes (chronic plaques) → gliosis</span>  → inadequate remyelination
- B-[[../Blood/Lymphocyte|lymphocyte]] dysfunction: The following suggests that B-lymphocytes play a role in the pathogenesis of MS, although the exact mechanism of their involvement is unclear.
	- Anti-CD20 agents (ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, rituximab) are effective in preventing exacerbations. 
	- Presence of tertiary lymphoid organs in the meninges of individuals with secondary progressive MS
	- Intrathecal synthesis of IgG (oligoclonal bands; see “Diagnostics” section for more information)
- Progressive phenotypes (forms) of MS are characterized by
	- Chronic inflammation that occurs with an intact blood-brain barrier and is driven by immune cells compartmentalized in the leptomeninges and perivascular spaces
	- Accelerated compared to relapsing-remitting phenotype brain atrophy

# Clinical features
![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230923161821.png|Pasted image 20230923161821.png]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Optic neuritis</span>
	- Most often the earliest manifestation
	- Typically unilateral
	- Can be painful
	- Impaired vision and color blindness
	- Relative afferent pupillary defect (Marcus Gunn pupil)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[./Internuclear ophthalmoplegia|Internuclear ophthalmoplegia]] (INO) as a result of a lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) </span>
	- Ipsilateral medial rectus weakness but an intact convergence reflex
	- Disconjugate, lateral gaze nystagmus in the contralateral eye
	- More frequently bilateral than unilateral
- Demyelination of spinal cord tracts
	- Lhermitte sign: a shooting electric sensation that travels down the spine upon flexion of the neck 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pyramidal tract lesion: upper motor neuron weakness, spasticity, hyperreflexia, positive Babinski sign, impaired [[./Gait|gait]]</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dorsal spinal column lesion</span>: loss of vibration and fine-touch sensation, numbness, paresthesias, [[./Gait|sensory ataxia]] usually involving the trunk or one or more limbs 
	- Neuropathic pain
	- Absent abdominal reflex
- Cerebellar involvement: poor postural control, imbalance, [[./Gait|gait]] dysfunction, Charcot neurological triad of scanning speech, nystagmus, and intention tremors 
- Transverse myelitis
	- Asymmetric paraplegia, unilateral sensory loss, bladder dysfunction
	- Partial transverse myelitis is a common early manifestation of MS, causing asymmetric neurologic dysfunction below the lesion.
- Cranial nerve palsies: diplopia, facial palsy, trigeminal neuralgia (can be bilateral)
	- Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) typically manifests unilaterally.
	- Bilateral TN should raise concern for MS, especially in younger patients. 
- Autonomic dysfunction: bowel and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">bladder neurogenic disorders</span> (e.g., [[../Renal/Urinary incontinence|urinary incontinence]]), impaired sexual function 
- Changes in mental state: depression, emotional changes, memory deficits, impaired concentration 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Uhthoff phenomenon: a reversible exacerbation of neurological symptoms following an increase in body temperature</span>, e.g., physical exertion, a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">warm bath</span>, or fever
	- Impulse conduction is dependent on temperature. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">An increase in body temperature presumably worsens impulse conduction in demyelinated nerves.</span>

>[!tip] 
>MS is a chronic condition that typically manifests in a relapsing-remitting form characterized by episodic CNS dysfunction (exacerbations) with at least partial recovery between episodes.

# Diagnostics
- Diagnosis of MS depends on <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">a combination of clinical findings (e.g., optic neuritis, Lhermitte sign, sensory abnormalities, cerebellar signs), imaging, and laboratory results.</span>
- The McDonald Criteria for both DIT and DIS must both be met to confirm a diagnosis of MS: 
	- Dissemination in time (DIT): the appearance of new CNS lesions over time that can be confirmed clinically, with imaging, or with CSF analysis
	- Dissemination in space (DIS): the presence of lesions in different regions of the CNS that can be confirmed clinically or in MRI
## Imaging
- MRI:<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> Multiple sclerotic plaques (most commonly found in the periventricular white matter)</span> with finger-like radial extensions (Dawson fingers) related to demyelination and reactive gliosis![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231231095808.png|Pasted image 20231231095808.png]]![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231231095812.png|Pasted image 20231231095812.png]]There are extensive demyelinating lesions (plaques) bilaterally, appearing as hyperintensities in the periventricular white matter (green overlay). The finger-like radial extensions of these lesions are called “Dawson fingers.”
## Additional studies
- CSF examination
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Oligoclonal bands</span>
		- Oligoclonal bands manifest <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">due to increased production of multiple nonspecific IgG sub-fractions in the CSF, which are caused by intrathecal inflammation.</span>
	- Other common findings: moderate <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">lymphocytic pleocytosis, increased myelin basic protein</span>

>[!tip] 
>The presence of multiple oligoclonal bands in CSF and their absence in the blood is highly suggestive of MS.
