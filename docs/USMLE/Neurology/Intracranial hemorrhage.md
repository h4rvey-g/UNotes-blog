## Etiology
- Traumatic SAH: traumatic brain injury
- Nontraumatic (spontaneous) SAH
	- Ruptured intracranial aneurysms
		- Most commonly occur in the circle of Willis 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Berry aneurysms account for approx. 80% of cases of nontraumatic SAH. </span>
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Also known as Saccular aneurysm because of the shape</span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240526113641.png|Pasted image 20240526113641.png]]
			- Round, saccular shape
			- Most common type of cerebral aneurysm
			- Typically occur at vessel junctions in the circle of Willis, most commonly between the anterior communicating artery and anterior cerebral artery
			- Account for ∼ 80% of cases of nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage
	- Ruptured arteriovenous malformations (AVM) 
## Diagnosis
### CT head without contrast
- Defining feature: blood in subarachnoid space (hyperdense) with variable extension and location![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231011165433.png|Pasted image 20231011165433.png]]![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231011165456.png|Pasted image 20231011165456.png]]
## Treatment
### Initial management
- Prevention of rebleeding 
	- Anticoagulant reversal
	- Management of blood pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure
		- Target SBP < 160 mm Hg
- Other neuroprotective measures 
	- Start ICP management (e.g., elevate head 30°, IV mannitol, short-term controlled hyperventilation).
### Treatment of aneurysmal SAH
- Intracranial aneurysm repair
	- Endovascular coiling
	- Microsurgical clipping
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Prevention of vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Administer oral nimodipine</span>
		- Only administer nimodipine orally or via enteral tube; Parenteral administration is associated with significant adverse effects (e.g., severe hypotension and cardiac arrest).
	- Treatment of hydrocephalus: may include an external ventricular drain (EVD), lumbar drainage, or permanent ventriculoperitoneal shunt

>[!warning] 
>Generally avoid nitrates for blood pressure control in brain injury, as they may elevate ICP. Consider alternative agents (e.g., titratable nicardipine or labetalol).
## Complications
### Vasospasm
- Occurs in approx. 30% of patients with SAH
- Pathophysiology
	- Impaired CSF reabsorption from the arachnoid villi → nonobstructive (communicating) hydrocephalus → ↑ intracranial pressure → ↓ cerebral perfusion pressure → ischemia
	- Release of clotting factors and vasoactive substances → diffuse vasospasm of cerebral vessels  → ischemia
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Can lead to [[./Ischemic stroke|ischemic stroke]]</span>
- Most common in patients with nontraumatic SAH due to a ruptured aneurysm
- Usually occurs between <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">3–10 days after SAH</span>
- Oral <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">nimodipine</span> should be given after subarachnoid hemorrhage to prevent vasospasm
