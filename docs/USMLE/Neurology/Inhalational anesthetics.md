- Onset of action
	- Blood:gas partition coefficient (↑higher = slower)
		- The ratio of anesthetic concentrations in the blood and alveolar space when partial pressures in the two compartments are equal. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Higher blood-gas partition coefficients of an inhalational anesthetic correspond to higher solubility in the blood.</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Solubility in blood (↑higher = slower)</span>
- Potency (the dose of a drug required to produce a pharmacologic response of a specified intensity)
	- Oil/gas partition coefficient (↑higher = more potent)
	- MAC (↓lower = more potent)
		- Minimum Alveolar Concentration (of inhaled anesthetic) required to prevent 50% of subjects from moving in response to noxious stimulus.
		- Potency = 1/MAC
# Adverse effects
- Postoperative nausea and vomiting
- Risk of malignant hyperthermia (except nitrous oxide)
- Decrease vascular resistance in brain and lead to an increase in cerebral blood flow → increased ICP
