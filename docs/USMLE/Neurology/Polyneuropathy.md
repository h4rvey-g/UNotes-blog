# Pathophysiology


---
# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Symmetrical distal sensory loss (glove and stocking pattern)  </span>
	- Vibratory perception is often lost first, followed by loss of pin-prick, temperature, and light touch perception.
- May be accompanied by neuropathic pain, paresthesias, and motor weakness
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Burning-foot syndrome: burning pain, tingling, pins-and-needles sensation, or formication</span> , hyperhidrosis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Atrophy of muscles</span>: e.g., stork legs in the case of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[./Gait|Sensory ataxia]]: caused by loss of sensation, particularly proprioception, that affects the afferent limb of postural reflexes (e.g., due to [[../Biochemistry/Vitamin B12|vitamin B12 deficiency]]).</span>
