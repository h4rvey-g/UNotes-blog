# Epidemiology
- Peak incidence
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">∼ 40 years of age (symptom onset usually between 20 and 50 years of age)</span>
	- One of the most common hereditary diseases of the brain

---
# Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increased number of CAG repeats (trinucleotide or triplet repeat expansion) in the huntingtin gene on chromosome 4 </span>(most likely due to DNA polymerase dysfunction) results in the expression of an altered huntingtin protein.
	- Huntingtin is physiologically expressed throughout the CNS, but its exact function is not known.
- Autosomal dominant
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anticipation: increase in the number of CAG repeats in subsequent generations</span>
	- In genetics, the term “anticipation” refers to the increasing severity and/or increasingly earlier manifestation of a disease from generation to generation. This phenomenon is observed in HD.

# Pathophysiology
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Molecular and cellular changes lead to neuronal loss and gliosis in the striatum (particularly in the caudate nucleus)</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Early stages: only the indirect pathway is affected → increased dopaminergic transmission → excess cortical activity → hyperkinetic/choreatic movements</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Later stages: both pathways are affected, which, together with additional factors → overall decrease of excitatory thalamic transmission to the cortex → hypokinetic/akinetic symptoms</span>
- Neuronal injury and death is caused by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">overactivation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors through excessive glutamate stimulation (glutamate-induced excitotoxicity)</span>, which leads to:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Alteration of GABAergic neurotransmission → decreased [[./Neurotransmitters|GABA]] in the brain</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dysfunction of cholinergic transmission (early stage) and loss of cholinergic neurons (late stage) → decreased [[./Neurotransmitters|acetylcholine]] ([[./Neurotransmitters|Ach]]) in the brain</span>

# Clinical features
- Initial stages
	- Movement dysfunction
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Chorea: involuntary, sudden, irregular, nonrepetitive, arrhythmic movements of the limbs, neck, head, and/or face</span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240328163130.png|Pasted image 20240328163130.png]][Neurological examination - AMBOSS](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/o500Og?q=Chorea#Z97d19ec1299d17fc7b63b0eb80ab9b1e)
		- Athetosis: involuntary, writhing movements, particularly of the hands and fingers
- Advanced stages
	- Movement dysfunction
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypokinetic motor symptoms: dystonia, [[../MSK/Spasticity (Clonus) vs Rigidity|rigidity]], bradykinesia </span>
		- Akinetic mutism: inability to move or speak
		- Motor impersistence: inability to sustain simple voluntary acts (e.g., tongue protrusion)
		- Dysarthria and dysphagia
	- Cognitive decline, psychiatric symptoms, and behavioral changes (these symptoms may mimic substance use)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[./Dementia|Dementia]]</span> (particularly executive dysfunction)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Psychiatry/Major depressive disorder|Major depressive disorder]]</span> (possibly including suicidal tendencies)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Psychiatry/Schizophrenia|Schizophrenia]]-like psychosis</span> (∼ 10% of cases)
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Paranoid delusions (most common)</span>, delusions of infidelity
			- Auditory hallucinations
		- Aggression

>[!tip] 
>Chorea characterizes the early stages of the disease while hypokinetic/akinetic symptoms may dominate later on. [[./Dementia|Dementia]], depression, and behavioral disorders are common in advanced stages.

# Diagnostics
- Genetic testing (e.g. polymerase chain reaction)
- <font color="#ffc000">CT/MRI: atrophy of the striatum, most pronounced in the caudate nucleus with consequent enlargement of ventricles (ex vacuo ventriculomegaly)</font>
