- Definition: an inherited genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of cystine in the kidneys and bladder due to a disruption of amino acid transporter function in the proximal convoluted tubule and intestine.
- Pathophysiology: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">impaired renal reabsorption of dibasic amino acids (cystine, ornithine, arginine, lysine) → accumulation of cystine in the urine → frequent formation of hexagonal cystine stones</span>
>[!Mnemonic] 
> <font color="#ffc000">C</font>ystine, <font color="#ffc000">O</font>rnithine, <font color="#ffc000">L</font>ysine, and <font color="#ffc000">A</font>rginine (<font color="#ffc000">COLA</font>) share a common transporter in kidney and intestine.
- Clinical features: recurrent [[../Renal/Nephrolithiasis#Cystine stones|nephrolithiasis > Cystine stones]], starting as early as childhood
- Diagnostics
	- Urine microscopy: hexagonal cystine stones
	- Urinary cyanide nitroprusside test: positive
- Treatment: increase cystine solubility to counter the formation of renal stones
	- Adequate hydration
	- Urinary alkalinization: acetazolamide, potassium citrate
	- Chelating agents: penicillamine
