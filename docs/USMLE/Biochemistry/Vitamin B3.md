# Function
>[!Mnemonic] 
>Active forms of <font color="#ffc000">N</font>iacin are <font color="#ffc000">N</font>AD+ and <font color="#ffc000">N</font>ADP+.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cofactor for redox reactions</span> (e.g., alcohol dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, G6PD)
# Therapeutic use
- Dyslipidemia: Niacin lowers VLDL and increases HDL serum levels (See [[../Cardiology/Lipid-lowering agents|Lipid-lowering agents]])

---
# Vitamin B3 deficiency
## Etiology
- Malnutrition
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Heavy drinking</span>
- Conditions associated with tryptophan deficiency
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hartnup disease: decreased renal and intestinal tryptophan absorption</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Endocrine/Carcinoid tumor|Carcinoid syndrome]] (if metabolically active): increased tryptophan metabolism</span>
- [[./Vitamin B6|Vitamin B6]] deficiency (e.g., due to treatment with isoniazid): decreased niacin synthesis from tryptophan
- Chronic consumption of grains that have not been processed by nixtamalization (common cause in developing countries)

		- Hyperpigmented skin lesions in sun-exposed areas (especially on the limbs) 
	- [[../GI/Diarrhea|Diarrhea]] and vomiting

# Vitamin B3 toxicity
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Facial flushing: due to prostaglandin release and NOT due to histamine (typically seen when niacin therapy is started, can be avoided by coadministration of <font color="#ffc000">aspirin</font>)</span>
- [[../MSK/Gout|Hyperuricemia]], podagra 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Niacin decreases renal uric acid excretion.</span>
- Hyperglycemia
