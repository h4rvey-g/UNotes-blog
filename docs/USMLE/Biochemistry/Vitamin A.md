- Vision: component of rhodopsin as 11-cis-retinal
- Gene transcription
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)</span> binds to its nuclear receptors (retinoic acid receptors, RAR; retinoid X receptors, RXR) → receptor dimerization → binding to DNA → uncoiling of chromatin → exposure of promoter regions of genes → binding of transcription factors to promoter → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">initiation of transcription and cell differentiation</span>
	- Regulation of various genes responsible for cell growth, cell differentiation, apoptosis, reproduction (e.g., spermatogenesis), and embryonic development
- Tissue maintenance and cell differentiation
	- Mainly retinoic acid
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Promotes differentiation of epithelium into specialized tissue (e.g., pancreatic cells and goblet cells)</span>
	- Prevents metaplasia of squamous cells
- Antioxidant
# Vitamin A deficiency
## Causes
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Disorders associated with fat [[../GI/Malabsorption|malabsorption]]: inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., [[../GI/Crohn disease|Crohn disease]]), [[../GI/Celiac disease|celiac disease]], [[./Cystic fibrosis|cystic fibrosis]], pancreatic insufficiency</span>
	- Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency → lack of digestive enzymes → [[../GI/Malabsorption|malabsorption]] of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K), and [[./Vitamin B12|vitamin B12]]
## Clinical features
- Ocular manifestations
	- Night blindness (nyctalopia)
	- Retinopathy
	- Xerophthalmia
	- Keratomalacia
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bitot spots: gray, triangular, dry patches on the bulbar conjunctiva, covered by a layer with a foamy appearance </span>
		- Typical sign of vitamin A deficiency
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Caused by squamous cell metaplasia and keratinization of the conjunctiva</span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231103111548.png|Pasted image 20231103111548.png]]
- Keratinizing squamous metaplasia of the bladder (pearl-like plaques on cystoscopy)
- Xerosis cutis
- Immunosuppression: Vitamin A deficiency increases the risk of a measles infection taking a severe course.
