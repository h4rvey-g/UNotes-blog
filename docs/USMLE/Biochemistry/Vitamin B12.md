# Functions
- Cofactor for enzymes:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[./Methionine|Methionine]] synthase: Methylcobalamin is required for the transfer of methyl groups (e.g., in DNA synthesis).</span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231225210715.png|Pasted image 20231225210715.png]]
	- Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (e.g., in odd-chain fatty acid metabolism)![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231225210648.png|Pasted image 20231225210648.png]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hydroxocobalamin (precursor of vitamin B12) is used to treat [[../Blood/Cyanide poisoning|Cyanide poisoning]]</span>

# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- [[../GI/Malabsorption|Malabsorption]]
	- ↓ Intrinsic factor (IF)
		- Atrophic gastritis due to
			- Autoimmune atrophic gastritis: most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency
			- H. pylori infection
		- Gastrectomy 
	- Reduced uptake of IF-vitamin B12 complex in terminal ileum due to:
		- Alcohol use disorder
		- [[../GI/Crohn disease|Crohn disease]], [[../GI/Celiac disease|celiac disease]]
		- Pancreatic insufficiency
		- Surgical resection of the ileum
		- Diphyllobothrium latum (tapeworm) infection
		- Bacterial overgrowth
		- Enteritis
		- Achlorhydria
- Malnutrition
	- [[../Psychiatry/Anorexia nervosa|Anorexia nervosa]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Strict vegan diets: occurs only after years of a strict diet that excludes all animal products (unlike folate deficiency, which occurs within a few months of insufficient intake)</span>
		- Found almost exclusively in animal products (except yeast extract)
- Increased demand: e.g., during [[../Reproductive/Pregnancy|pregnancy]], breastfeeding, fish tapeworm (Diphyllobothrium latum) infection, and leukemia
- Drugs: metformin

# Pathophysiology
## Dysfunctional biochemical reactions
- Dysfunctional [[./Methionine|methionine]] synthase (normally converts homocysteine to [[./Methionine|methionine]], thereby demethylating N5-methyl-THF to THF) 
	- ↓ Tetrahydrofolate (THF; cofactor in purine synthesis) → ↓ DNA synthesis → large, nucleated hematopoietic cells, including megaloblasts  → megaloblastic precursors undergo apoptosis or are phagocytosed by macrophages → pancytopenia (including megaloblastic anemia)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ [[./Methionine|Methionine]] → neuropathy</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Homocysteine</span> → endothelial damage → predisposes to cardiovascular disease
	- Can also cause secondary folate deficiency
- Dysfunctional methylmalonyl CoA mutase
	- Methylmalonyl CoA cannot be converted to succinyl CoA → accumulation of methylmalonyl CoA and its precursor propionyl CoA, as well as their associated odd-chain fatty acids, which cannot be completely metabolized
	- Propionyl CoA replaces acetyl CoA in neuronal membranes → demyelination → neurological manifestations
## Pernicious anemia
- A type of vitamin B12 deficiency caused by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">autoantibodies against [[../GI/Intrinsic factor|intrinsic factor]] and/or gastric parietal cells</span> (type II hypersensitivity reaction)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Antiparietal cell antibodies: target gastric parietal cells</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Causes ↓ acid production and atrophic gastritis</span>
			- In turn <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increases gastrin level</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ [[../GI/Intrinsic factor|Intrinsic factor]] production → ↓ vitamin B12 absorption in terminal ileum</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anti-IF antibodies</span>: bind [[../GI/Intrinsic factor|intrinsic factor]] and block the vitamin B12 binding site
- Associated with other autoimmune diseases (e.g., hypothyroidism, vitiligo)
- Increases the risk of gastric cancer

# Clinical features
- Signs of anemia (e.g., fatigue, pallor) 
- Neurological disturbances are generally symmetrical
	- Peripheral neuropathy: tingling, numbness, pins-and-needles sensation, coldness (especially in the lower extremities)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord: symmetrical demyelination of the spinal cord tracts occurs in vitamin B12 deficiency due to insufficient vitamin B12-dependent fatty acid synthesis and production/maintenance of myelin</span>
		- It manifests with the following symptoms:
			- Paresthesia, impaired proprioception, loss of vibratory sensation, tactile sensation, and position discrimination due to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">demyelination of the dorsal columns</span>
			- Spastic paresis due to demyelination of the lateral corticospinal tracts (axons of upper motor neurons)
			- [[../Neurology/Gait|Gait]] abnormalities (spinal ataxia) resulting from the damage of spinocerebellar tracts and dorsal columns, [[../Neurology/Romberg test|Romberg test]] (+)
		- Long-term deficiency can lead to irreversible neurological damage.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Neuropsychiatric disease</span> (e.g.,<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> reversible [[../Neurology/Dementia|dementia]]</span>, depression, paranoia)
	- Worsening vision 
	- Autonomic dysfunction: impotence and incontinence
- Glossitis

>[!tip] 
>Always consider vitamin B12 deficiency when evaluating patients with [[../Neurology/Dementia|dementia]].

# Diagnostics
- If vitamin B12 serum levels are normal:
	- Measure homocysteine: elevated in both vitamin B12 deficiency and folate deficiency
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Measure methylmalonic acid (MMA) to help rule out folate deficiency (MMA is normal in folate deficiency and elevated in vitamin B12 deficiency)</span>
		- Without vitamin B12, methylmalonyl CoA mutase cannot break down methylmalonyl CoA, which leads to the accumulation of MMA.![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231225210648.png|Pasted image 20231225210648.png]]
