# Epidemiology
- Most common viable autosomal chromosome aberration (∼ 1:700 live births) and most common genetic cause of cognitive impairment
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The risk of a Down syndrome pregnancy increases with maternal age.</span>
	- Incidence at 20 years: ∼ 1:2000
	- Incidence at 45 years: ∼ 1:30

# Etiology
## Full [[./Autosomal trisomies|trisomy]] 21 (∼ 95% of cases)
- Definition: three complete copies of chromosome 21 are present in all cells, with a total of 47 chromosomes
- Pathogenesis: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">meiotic nondisjunction</span>
- Karyotype: ♀: 47,XX,+21 or ♂: 47,XY,+21
## Translocation [[./Autosomal trisomies|trisomy]] 21 (3–4% of cases)
- Definition: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">three copies of chromosome 21 are present, one of which is attached to another chromosome, usually chromosome 14</span> (less likely attached to chromosomes 13, 15, or 22)
- Pathogenesis and karyotype
	- Balanced Robertsonian translocation: translocation of the long arm of chromosome 21 to the long arm of chromosome 14. Not symptomatic, but can affect future generations![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240214223619.png|Pasted image 20240214223619.png]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Unbalanced Robertsonian translocation: clinical features of trisomy 21 caused by inheritance of a translocation chromosome and a normal chromosome</span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240214223629.png|Pasted image 20240214223629.png]]
## Mosaic [[./Autosomal trisomies|trisomy]] 21 (1–2% of cases)
- Definition: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">two cell lines are present</span>, the [[./Autosomal trisomies|trisomy]] 21 cell line and the normal cell line
- Phenotypic expression varies according to the ratio of healthy to trisomic cells.
