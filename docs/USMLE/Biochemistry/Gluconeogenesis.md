# Primary substrates
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Glucogenic amino acids</span>: Generated from the hydrolysis of protein tissue (typically during [[./Metabolic fuel use|fasting]] > 1 week), these amino acids are capable of being converted to α-keto acids (e.g., oxaloacetate, α-ketoglutarate) and then to glucose. 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lactate</span>: Via the Cori cycle, lactate produced from anaerobic [[./Glycolysis|glycolysis]] (mostly in skeletal muscle) is shuttled to the liver, where it is converted to pyruvate, which serves as the first true substrate in gluconeogenesis.
- Propionyl-CoA
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Formed from odd-chain fatty acid [[./Fatty acid oxidation|β-oxidation]]</span>, this molecule can be carboxylated to form succinyl-CoA. Succinyl-CoA can enter the gluconeogenesis pathway after being converted to oxaloacetate via the [[./TCA cycle|TCA cycle]].
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Even-chain fatty acids can only be oxidized to acetyl-CoA, so they cannot be used for gluconeogenesis. </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Glycerol 3-phosphate:</span>
	1. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Released into the blood during hydrolysis of triacylglycerols in adipose tissue</span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240302103109.png|Pasted image 20240302103109.png]]
	2. Phosphorylated by glycerol kinase in the liver
	3. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Oxidized by glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (an intermediate of [[./Glycolysis|glycolysis]])</span>
