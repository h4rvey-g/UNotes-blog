- Normal intracranial ammonia physiology
	- Glutamate and ammonia exist in a chemical equilibrium with glutamine, mediated by the enzyme glutamine synthetase.
	- Glutamate serves as a substrate for glutamate decarboxylase to form [[../Neurology/Neurotransmitters|GABA]].

	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Elevated serum ammonia levels</span> disrupt the balance between glutamine, glutamate, α-ketoglutarate, and GABA through the actions of glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamine synthetase, resulting in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased glutamine and decreased glutamate levels → low [[../Neurology/Neurotransmitters|GABA]] synthesis and GABAergic tone</span> → typical features of hyperammonemic encephalopathy:
		- Excess glutamine → osmotic damage to astrocytes → cellular swelling and dysfunction → cerebral edema
		- Imbalance of the neurotransmitters → Inhibition of excitatory neurotransmission and activation of inhibitory neurotransmission
	- Low α-ketoglutarate → inhibition of [[./TCA cycle|TCA cycle]]
- Etiology
	- Hereditary: most often in children but heterozygotes can present as older children or adults
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[./Urea cycle|Urea cycle]] disorders, especially ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency</span>
		- Organic acidemias: most commonly methylmalonic acidemia
