# Definition
Rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by absent or dysmotile cilia caused by a defect in the dynein arm of microtubules.

# Pathophysiology

# Clinical features
- Chronic productive cough
- Recurrent otitis, [[../Respiratory/Sinusitis|sinusitis]], and nasal polyps
- [[../Respiratory/Bronchiectasis|Bronchiectasis]]
- Conductive [[../Neurology/Hearing loss|hearing loss]]
- Displaced heart sounds (as a result of dextrocardia)
- Infertility in men due to decreased sperm motility as a result of defective flagella
- Reduced fertility in women (and rarely ectopic pregnancy) due to defective cilia in fallopian tubes

>You can memorize the cause of Kartagener syndrome by thinking of Kartagener's restaurant that only has 'take-out' service because there is no dine-in (dynein).

# Diagnostics
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Nasal nitric oxide test: reduced nasal nitric oxide (screening test)</span>
- Genetic tests for dynein arm mutations
- Chest x-ray: bronchiectasis, dextrocardia, and situs inversus (suggests Kartagener syndrome)
