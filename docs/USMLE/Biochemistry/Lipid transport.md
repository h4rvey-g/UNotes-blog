>[!tip] Key Points
>- TG 
>	- Energy reserve
>	- Synthesized in liver and adipocytes
>	- Stored in adipocytes
>- Cholesterol
>	- Incorporated in all cell membranes in the lipid bilayer: increases membrane fluidity and stability
>	- Precursor for synthesis of:
>		- Steroid hormones (e.g., androgens, estrogens, mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids)
>		- Bile acids
>		- Vitamin D
>	- Transport in blood via lipoproteins
>		- From the intestine to the liver: together with TAGs in chylomicrons
>		- From the liver to peripheral tissues: via VLDL and LDL
>		- From peripheral tissues to the liver (reverse cholesterol transport): via HDL and IDL
>- HDL
>	- Transport cholesterol from peripheral tissues (e.g., atherosclerotic arteries) to the liver (reverse cholesterol transport), where it is excreted (e.g., via bile)
>- LDL
>	- Transport cholesterol from the liver to peripheral tissues and arteries
>- VLDL
>	- Transport hepatic triglycerides from the liver to peripheral tissues
>- Chylomicron
>	- Secreted by the intestinal epithelial cells into lymphatics
>	- Transport dietary triglycerides from the intestine to peripheral tissues
