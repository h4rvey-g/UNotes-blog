# Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Primary hypothyroidism: insufficient thyroid hormone production</span>
	- [[../Endocrine/Hashimoto thyroiditis|Hashimoto thyroiditis]]
		- The most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient regions
		- Associated with HLA-DR3 and other autoimmune diseases (e.g., vitiligo, pernicious anemia, type 1 [[../Endocrine/Diabetes mellitus|diabetes mellitus]], and [[../Immunology/Systemic lupus erythematosus|systemic lupus erythematosus]])
	- Postpartum thyroiditis ([[../Endocrine/Subacute thyroiditis|subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis]]) 
	- [[../Endocrine/Subacute thyroiditis|De Quervain thyroiditis]] ([[../Endocrine/Subacute thyroiditis|subacute granulomatous thyroiditis]]): often subsequent to a flu-like illness
	- Iatrogenic: e.g., post thyroidectomy, radioiodine therapy, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">antithyroid medication (e.g., amiodarone, lithium)</span>
	- Nutritional (insufficient intake of iodine): the most common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide, particularly in iodine-deficient regions
	- [[../Endocrine/Riedel thyroiditis|Riedel thyroiditis]]: occurs in IgG4-related systemic disease
	- Wolff-Chaikoff effect
	- Thyroid dysplasia: a disorder of embryologic development characterized by abnormal development and/or location of thyroid tissue (e.g., lingual thyroid)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Secondary hypothyroidism: pituitary disorders (e.g., [[../Endocrine/Pituitary adenoma|pituitary adenoma]]) → TSH deficiency</span>
- Tertiary hypothyroidism: hypothalamic disorders → TRH deficiency

# Clinical features
- Symptoms related to decreased metabolic rate
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hair loss (Queen Anne sign), brittle nails, and cold, dry skin</span>
- Symptoms related to generalized myxedema
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hoarse voice, difficulty articulating words</span>
- Symptoms of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Endocrine/Hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia]]</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Abnormal menstrual cycle (esp. secondary amenorrhea or menorrhagia)</span>

# Treatment
Hypothyroidism is treated with lifelong hormone substitution.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Levothyroxine: synthetic form of T4</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">First-line choice</span> for the treatment of hypothyroidism
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Peripherally converted to T3</span> (biologically active metabolite) and rT3 (biologically inactive metabolite)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Liothyronine: synthetic form of T3</span>
	- Part of the treatment for myxedema coma
	- Not recommended as monotherapy or in combination with levothyroxine for the long-term treatment of hypothyroidism
		- Liothyronine has a short half-life and requires three to four daily doses, making it less suitable than levothyroxine for the ongoing treatment of hypothyroidism.

# Congenital hypothyroidism
## Clinical features
- Umbilical hernia
- Prolonged [[../Reproductive/Neonatal jaundice|neonatal jaundice]]
	- Most commonly, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia
		- Primarily due to decreased UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity
- Hypotonia
- Decreased activity, poor feeding, and adipsia 
- Hoarse cry, macroglossia
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cretinism: a complication of severe, untreated congenital hypothyroidism that leads to impaired development of the brain and skeleton, resulting in skeletal abnormalities (e.g., short stature and delayed fontanelle closure) and permanent intellectual disabilities</span>
>[!warning] 
>Most children with congenital hypothyroidism do not have symptoms at the time of birth because the placenta supplies the fetus with maternal thyroid hormone. For this reason, neonatal screening is vital even if children are asymptomatic. Irreversible intellectual disabilities can be avoided through early initiation of adequate therapy!

## Diagnostics
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Neonatal screening to measure TSH levels</span> 24–48 hours after birth is required by law.
- Increased TSH levels indicate congenital hypothyroidism.
