- Ketone bodies
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Water-soluble molecules that are produced by the liver and used by peripheral tissues</span> (e.g., heart, brain, skeletal muscle) as <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">an energy source when glucose is not readily available</span> (e.g., during prolonged [[./Metabolic fuel use|starvation]], in [[../Endocrine/Hyperglycemic crises|diabetic ketoacidosis]], or chronic heavy drinking)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Three ketone bodies: acetoacetate, β-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone (acetone is a breakdown product of acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate; has a fruity smell)</span>
		- The prefix "acet-" is commonly associated with acetic acid and its derivatives, from which acetone is derived.

><span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Liver is only used for synthesizing ketone bodies, not using them. Ketone bodies are then transported to other organs via bloodstream.</span>
>- Liver cells lack β ketoacyl-CoA transferase → cannot use ketone bodies as fuel.
- Regulation:
	- In prolonged [[./Metabolic fuel use|fasting]] and [[../Endocrine/Hyperglycemic crises|diabetic ketoacidosis]]
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Oxaloacetate is depleted for [[./Gluconeogenesis|gluconeogenesis]].</span>
		- This results in a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">buildup of acetyl-CoA molecules → shunts the pathway toward the production of ketone bodies.</span>
	- In alcoholism
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Excess NADH shunts oxaloacetate to malate.</span>
		- This results in a buildup of acetyl-CoA molecules → shunts the pathway toward the production of ketone bodies.
