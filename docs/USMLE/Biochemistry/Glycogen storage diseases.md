# Pompe disease

- This condition is caused by deficiency of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">acid alpha-glucosidase (alpha-1,4 glucosidase or acid maltase)</span>, an enzyme responsible for breaking down glycogen within the acidic environment of lysosomes.
- Although most glycogen is degraded in the cytoplasm,<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> a small percentage is inadvertently engulfed by lysosomes</span>, especially in cells containing high amounts of glycogen such as hepatocytes and myocytes. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> Deficiency of acid maltase results in pathologic accumulation of glycogen within liver and muscle lysosomes.  Cardiac and skeletal muscle are particularly susceptible because the ballooning lysosomes interfere with contractile function.</span>
