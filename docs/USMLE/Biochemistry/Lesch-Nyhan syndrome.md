Definition: inherited genetic disorder characterized by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">impaired purine salvage pathway, resulting in an overproduction of uric acid</span>

# Pathophysiology
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Defect in the enzyme</span> hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">HGPRT</span>) → impaired conversion of hypoxanthine to IMP and guanine to GMP → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">excess uric acid and ↑ de novo purine synthesis</span>![[../../assets/img/highresdefault_L95797.png|highresdefault_L95797.png]]![[../../assets/img/L23656.jpg|L23656.jpg]]

# Clinical features
- Usually asymptomatic for the first 6 months of life
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Orange sand-like sodium urate crystals can be found in the diapers of infants with [[../MSK/Gout|hyperuricemia]].</span>
	- See [[../Renal/Nephrolithiasis#Uric acid stones|Nephrolithiasis > Uric acid stones]]
- Developmental delay and cognitive impairment
- Pyramidal and extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g., dystonia, [[../MSK/Spasticity (Clonus) vs Rigidity|spasticity]])
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Gouty arthritis, urate nephropathy </span>
	- Due to the accumulation of uric acid in peripheral tissues
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Aggression, self-injurious behavior </span>
	- E.g., <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">finger chewing, lip biting, headbanging</span>
- Renal failure

# Diagnostics
- [[../MSK/Gout|Hyperuricemia]]
- ↓ HGPRT activity
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (converts PRPP to GMP and AMP)</span>
- Macrocytosis (megaloblastic anemia may occur)

---
# Treatment
- Reduce uric acid levels:
	- Allopurinol (first-line)
	- Febuxostat (second-line)
	- Low-purine diet
