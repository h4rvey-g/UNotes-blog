# Alcohol intoxication
---
## Pathophysiology
- Mechanism 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Neurology/Neurotransmitters|GABA]]-A receptor agonist → Chronic use causes downregulation of GABA-A receptors → decreased GABA-A activity when cessation</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">NMDA glutamate antagonist → chronic use causes upregulation of NMDA receptors → increased glutamate NMDA activity when cessation</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Absorption: The majority of alcohol consumed is absorbed by the proximal small intestine</span>; only a small amount of alcohol is absorbed by the oral, esophageal, and/or gastric mucosa.
## Clinical features
Altered consciousness, cognition, perception, judgment, affect, and/or behavior.
## Diagnostics
- Routine laboratory studies that support the diagnosis include:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Elevated osmolar gap</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The difference between the measured serum osmolarity and the calculated serum osmolarity.</span> Normally, the calculated serum osmolarity is primarily determined by circulating levels of sodium salts (chloride and bicarbonate), glucose, and urea. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">An increased serum osmolar gap occurs when other solutes (e.g., ethanol, methanol, propylene glycol) are present</span> in high enough concentrations to increase the measured osmolarity by more than 10 mOsmol/L.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anion gap metabolic acidosis</span> (e.g., ↓ pH, ↓ HCO3-)
