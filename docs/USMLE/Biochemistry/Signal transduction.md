## cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate)
- Synthesis: cGMP is synthesized from GTP by the guanylate cyclase. There are two subforms of guanylate cyclase:
	- Soluble guanylate cyclase: activated by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">nitric oxide</span>
	- Membrane-bound guanylate cyclase: activated through extracellular ligand binding (e.g., EDRF, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">ANP, BNP</span>)

>[!tip] 
>Both lead to vasodilation.
- Effects
	- Activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase G in smooth muscle cells → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">inhibits Ca2+ outflow from the sarcoplasmic reticulum → ↓ intracellular Ca2+ → relaxed smooth vascular muscles → vasodilation</span>
	- cGMP-dependent ion channels in the photoreceptor cells of the retina → preserve the unstimulated state → dark signal
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Degradation: by phosphodiesterase</span> to GMP
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">So [[../Pharmacology/Phosphodiesterase inhibitors|PDE inhibitors]] work as vasodilators, used in the treatment of [[../Respiratory/Pulmonary hypertension|pulmonary hypertension]] (PDE-4 inhibitor roflumilast) and erectile dysfunction (PDE-5 inhibitor sildenafil).</span>
### IP3 and DAG
- Synthesis![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240404172938.png|Pasted image 20240404172938.png]]
	1. Activation of a Gq protein-coupled receptor
	2. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Activation of phospholipase C</span> (an enzyme that cleaves phospholipids) 
	3. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cleaving of the membrane-bound phospholipids PIP2</span> (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) into the second messenger <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">IP3</span> (inositol triphosphate) and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">DAG</span> (diacylglycerol)
- Function
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">IP3</span> (hydrophilic) diffuses into the cytoplasm → activation of IP3 receptors at the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ca2+ release from the ER</span> via the IP3 receptor-coupled [[../Cardiology/Calcium Channel|calcium channel]] → ↑ intracellular Ca2+ concentration → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">smooth muscle contraction</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">DAG</span> (lipophilic) remains in the membrane → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">activates protein kinase C (PKC)</span> 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">PKC is Ca2+-dependent (depends on IP3-mediated Ca2+ release)</span>
- Mechanism of action: regulates the activity of various enzymes via phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues, e.g., regulatory proteins that influence cell growth (actin [[../Pathology/Cytoskeleton|cytoskeleton]]) or differentiation (EGFR)
- Examples of the effect of PKC: cell growth and proliferation
- Examples of ligands: vasopressin (V1 receptor), oxytocin, GnRH, TRH, angiotensin, gastrin, histamine (H1 receptor)
### Ca2+ as a second messengers
- Effect of Ca2+, especially as a complex with calmodulin: One molecule of calmodulin binds up to four Ca2+ ions → conformational change → regulation of calmodulin-dependent kinases/phosphatases, e.g., CaM kinase III (protein synthesis)
