# Etiology
- Risk factors for sporadic RCC
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Smoking</span>
	- Obesity
- Hereditary renal cell carcinomas
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Neurology/Neurocutaneous disorders|Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome]]</span>: Approx. 40% of patients with VHL syndrome develop renal cell carcinomas (usually clear cell RCC).

# Pathology
Renal cell carcinomas are adenocarcinomas that usually arise from the epithelial cells of the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">proximal convoluted tubule</span> (80%).
- Clear cell renal cell carcinoma
	- Frequency: 70%
	- Etiology: Sporadic or inherited mutation of VHL gene on chromosome 3p
	- Microscopic appearance: 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Polygonal cells</span> arranged as cords or tubules (non-papillary growth)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Clear, glycogen and/or lipid-filled cytoplasm</span>
 
 >[!Mnemonic] 
>Rule of **3**: A mutation in the **VHL** (von Hippel-Lindau) gene on chromosome **3** causes **RCC** (renal cell carcinoma).

# Diagnostics
## Pathology
### <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Clear cell renal cell carcinoma</span>
- Macroscopic appearance
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Yellow or golden due to high intracellular lipid concentration</span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240331164512.png|Pasted image 20240331164512.png]]
- Microscopic appearance
	- Clear cells 
		- Polygonal cells arranged as cords or tubules (non-papillary growth)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Clear, glycogen and/or lipid-filled cytoplasm</span>
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Mutations in the VHL gene lead to accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). </span>
			- The accumulation of HIF promotes a cellular environment that <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">mimics hypoxia (low oxygen levels)</span>, even when oxygen is abundant. This state triggers several metabolic changes in the cell, notably<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> an increase in glucose uptake and a shift towards [[../Biochemistry/Glycolysis|glycolysis]] and lipid biosynthesis.</span> Consequently, lipids accumulate within the cytoplasm, giving the cells their characteristic "clear" appearance.
	- Unifocal, unilateral growth

# Differential diagnosis
## Benign renal masses
### Oncocytoma
- Definition: benign epithelial tumor arising from the intercalated tubular cells in the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">collecting duct</span>
>[!Mnemonic] 
>**<u>c</u>**ollecting ducts, well-**<u>c</u>**ircumscribed mass with <u>c</u>entral scar
- Clinical features 
	- Painless hematuria
	- Abdominal mass
	- Flank pain
- Pathology
	- Macroscopy: smooth, clearly defined brown tumor with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">central radial scar</span> ![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230820154628.png|Pasted image 20230820154628.png]]
	- Microscopy
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Large eosinophilic cells with abundant mitochondria without perinuclear clearing</span> (Compared with chromophobe renal cell carcinoma) ![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230820154953.png|Pasted image 20230820154953.png]]
		- Excessive amount of mitochondria â†’ acidophilic, granular cytoplasm without perinuclear clearing (unlike chromophobe RCC)
- Treatment
	- Often resected in order to exclude RCC
	- Surveillance

# Complications
## Complications caused by [[../Respiratory/Paraneoplastic syndromes|paraneoplastic syndromes]]
- Secondary [[../Endocrine/Cushing syndrome|hypercortisolism]]: due to ectopic ACTH release
- Secondary polycythemia: due to ectopic erythropoietin (EPO) secretion
- Hypertension: due to the release of renin
- [[../Cardiology/Hypercalcemia|Hypercalcemia]]: due to the release of [[./Parathyroid hormone-related protein|PTHrP]] ([[./Parathyroid hormone-related protein|parathyroid hormone-related protein]])
## Complications caused by local spread
- Varicocele
	- Rare, classically associated with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">left-sided RCC</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Malignant cells grow inside the left renal vein and occlude the ostium of the left gonadal vein.</span> 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../GI/Budd-Chiari syndrome|Budd-Chiari syndrome]]: caused by involvement of the IVC</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lower limb edema</span>
	- Ascites
	- Hepatic dysfunction
