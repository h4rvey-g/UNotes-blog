Can help diagnose the underlying cause in [[./Acute kidney injury|acute kidney injury]]
- 10:1–20:1 can be normal or may indicate a postrenal cause.
- ≥ 20:1 indicates prerenal cause: Urea reabsorption is increased, which is typical in patients with dehydration or hypoperfusion. 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Because increased urea reabsorption is mediated by ADH, in order to build medullary concentration gradient.</span> See [[./Renal physiology#Collecting duct|Renal physiology > Collecting duct]]
- ≤ 15:1 indicates intrarenal cause: Renal damage causes decreased urea reabsorption.
