# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
## Central diabetes insipidus (CDI)
- Most common form: caused by insufficient or absent hypothalamic synthesis or posterior pituitary secretion of ADH
	- Primary (∼ ⅓ of cases)
	- Secondary (∼ ⅔ of cases)
		- [[../Neurology/Brain tumors|Brain tumors]] (especially craniopharyngioma)
		- Neurosurgery
		- Traumatic brain injury, pituitary bleeding, [[../Neurology/Intracranial hemorrhage|subarachnoid hemorrhage]]
		- Pituitary ischemia (e.g., [[../Endocrine/Hypopituitarism|Sheehan syndrome]], [[../Neurology/Ischemic stroke|ischemic stroke]])
## Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI)
- Rare: caused by defective ADH receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts
- Hereditary (mutation in ADH receptor): very rare
- Acquired: typically reversible if the underlying cause is resolved

# Pathophysiology
>[!tip] 
>Note that in central DI, ADH levels are decreased, while in nephrogenic DI, they are normal or increased to compensate for the high urine output.

---
# Clinical features
- Polyuria with dilute urine 
- Nocturia → restless sleep, daytime sleepiness
- Polydipsia (excessive thirst)
- In cases of low water intake  → severe dehydration (altered mental status, lethargy, seizures, coma) and hypotension
- Symptoms may worsen during [[../Reproductive/Pregnancy|pregnancy]].
>[!tip] 
>In the absence of nocturia, diabetes insipidus is very unlikely.

# Diagnostics
## Serum sodium and plasma osmolality
- ↓ Na<sup>+</sup> and/or ↓ plasma osmolality: primary polydipsia likely 
- Normal values: diagnosis unclear; obtain subsequent studies to differentiate between polyuria-polydipsia syndromes.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Na<sup>+</sup> and/ or ↑ plasma osmolality: Diabetes insipidus likely</span>; obtain subsequent studies to differentiate between CDI and NDI.
## Water deprivation test (indirect assessment of ADH activity)
Urine concentrating capacity is assessed during a period of dehydration; desmopressin is then administered to assess response to a synthetic ADH analogue.![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231204113426.png|Pasted image 20231204113426.png]]
- Interpretation after period of water deprivation
	- [[./Urine osmolality|Urine osmolality]] increases to > 800 mOsm/kg: Primary polydipsia is confirmed.
	- [[./Urine osmolality|Urine osmolality]] remains ≤ 800 mOsm/kg: Administer desmopressin (a synthetic ADH analogue). 
- Interpretation after desmopressin administration
	- [[./Urine osmolality|Urine osmolality]] (300–800 mOsm/kg) and:
		- Significant increase (≥ 10%) after desmopressin: partial CDI
		- No or minimal increase (< 10%) after desmopressin: primary polydipsia
	- [[./Urine osmolality|Urine osmolality]] (< 300 mOsm/kg) and:
		- Significant increase (> 50%) after desmopressin: complete CDI (indicating intact renal ADH receptors)
		- No or moderate increase (< 50%) after desmopressin: NDI (indicating defective renal ADH receptors)
# Differential diagnostics
## Primary polydipsia (psychogenic polydipsia)
- Mechanism
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Compulsive water intake</span>
- Etiology
	- Psychiatric diseases (e.g., schizophrenia, [[../Psychiatry/Obsessive-compulsive disorder|obsessive-compulsive disorder]])
	- Lesions in the hypothalamic thirst center
- Features
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hyponatremia</span>
	- Low plasma osmolarity, very low urine osmolarity
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Water deprivation: plasma and urine osmolarity increase to normal level</span>

# Treatment
Encourage adequate fluid intake and a low-sodium, low-protein diet.
## Central diabetes insipidus
- Desmopressin (preferred): synthetic ADH analogue without vasoconstrictive effects 
	- Intranasal administration is preferred.
 - Chlorpropamide
## Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
- Treat the underlying cause, if applicable, e.g.:
	- Discontinue the causative agent (e.g., lithium, demeclocycline).
- Thiazide diuretics
	- Lead to sodium depletion, which increases sodium and water reabsorption in the proximal tubules
	- As a result, less water reaches the distal collecting tubules and urine volume decreases.
- NSAIDs (e.g., indomethacin) 
	- Inhibit renal prostaglandins that act as ADH antagonists
- Amiloride
