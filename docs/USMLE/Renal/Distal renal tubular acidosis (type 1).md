# Etiology
- Autoimmune diseases
- Chronic obstructive uropathy (e.g., congenital anomalies)
- Sickle cell nephropathy
- Drugs: ifosfamide, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Infective disease/Antifungals|amphotericin B]]</span>, lithium, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">NSAIDs (analgesic nephropathy)</span>

# Pathophysiology
The α-intercalated cells of the distal tubule are unable to secrete H<sup>+</sup> (apical) → ↓ intracellular production of HCO<sup>3-</sup>  → ↓ HCO<sup>3-</sup>/Cl<sup>-</sup> exchanger activity (basolateral) → decreased concentration of HCO<sup>3-</sup> in the blood → metabolic acidosis

# Clinical features
- Nephrocalcinosis: calcium phosphate stones (due to an increase in urine pH
- Bone demineralization usually without overt rickets or osteomalacia (due to increased bone turnover)
- Impaired growth
