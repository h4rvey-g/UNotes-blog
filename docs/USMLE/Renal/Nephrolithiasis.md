## Calcium stones
### Calcium oxalate stones
#### Etiology
- Hypercalciuria
- Hyperoxaluria
	- Increased intestinal absorption of oxalate, e.g., due to fatty acid [[../GI/Malabsorption|malabsorption]] (e.g., [[../GI/Crohn disease|Crohn disease]], [[../GI/Ulcerative colitis|ulcerative colitis]], short bowel syndrome)
	 - [[../Blood/Vitamin C# Vitamin C toxicity|Vitamin C >  Vitamin C toxicity]]
		 - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Blood/Vitamin C|Vitamin C]] is metabolized to oxalate</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypocitraturia</span>
	- Citrate inhibits stone formation by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">forming a soluble complex with calcium in the renal tubule, which reduces the amount of free calcium in the urine to bind with oxalate or phosphate.</span> Citrate excretion in the kidney is strongly influenced by pH (systemic, tubular, and intracellular). Alkalosis increases renal citrate excretion, whereas acidosis decreases it.

>[!tip] 
><span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Individuals with higher (but not excessive) calcium intake paradoxically have a lower risk of calcium oxalate stone formation.</span>  <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dietary calcium binds oxalate in the gut to form insoluble calcium oxalate</span>, which is eliminated in the feces.  This <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">reduces the amount of oxalate absorbed into the body</span> and excreted in the urine, reducing stone formation.
#### Diagnosis
- Urine microscopy: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">dumbbell-shaped</span> or octahedron-shaped crystals ![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230817154316.png|Pasted image 20230817154316.png]]
	- The monohydrate calcium oxalate crystal is described as the “picket fence” form. These dumbbells shaped crystals are common in ethylene glycol toxicity. The dihydrate form is octahedral or “envelope” shaped.![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230909155554.png|Pasted image 20230909155554.png]]
- X-ray (or CT): radiopaque stones
>[!tip] 
>Serum calcium can be normal or elevated.
#### Treatment
- Hydration
- Dietary modification
	- Reduced intake of salt (mainly sodium) and animal protein *(Low sodium enhances renal tubular reabsorption of sodium and calcium, decreasing urinary calcium levels. Animal protein consumption increases calcium excretion in urine.)*
	- Reduced intake of oxalate-rich foods and supplemental [[../Blood/Vitamin C|vitamin C]]
	- Calcium intake should not be restricted (restriction increases risk of hyperoxaluria, and thereby, the risk for [[../MSK/Osteoporosis|osteoporosis]]) 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Thiazide [[../Pharmacology/Diuretics|diuretics]]</span> for recurrent calcium-containing stones with idiopathic hypercalciuria (i.e., no [[../Cardiology/Hypercalcemia|hypercalcemia]])
- Urine alkalinization (e.g., with potassium citrate)
- Possibly citrate supplementation
### Calcium phosphate stones
#### Etiology
- [[../Endocrine/Hyperparathyroidism|Hyperparathyroidism]] (brushite)
- Type 1 renal tubular acidosis (brushite)
- Develop in persistently alkalic urine
#### Diagnosis
- Urine microscopy: wedge-shaped crystals![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230901152436.png|Pasted image 20230901152436.png]] 
- X-ray (or CT): radiopaque stones
#### Prevention
- Hydration
- Thiazide [[../Pharmacology/Diuretics|diuretics]]
- Diet low in sodium
## Uric acid stones
### Etiology
- [[../MSK/Gout|Hyperuricemia]] and hyperuricosuria
	- [[../MSK/Gout|Hyperuricemia]]
	- High cell turnover (e.g., [[./Tumor lysis syndrome|tumor lysis syndrome]], [[../Blood/Myelodysplastic syndromes|myelodysplastic syndrome]])
- [[../Endocrine/Diabetes mellitus|Diabetes mellitus]], metabolic syndrome
- Chronic diarrhea
### Diagnosis
- Urine microscopy: rhomboid/needle-shaped crystals ![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230817160628.png|Pasted image 20230817160628.png]]
- X-ray: radiolucent stones
- CT: can be visible but are usually only minimally visible (not as visible as calcium stones)
### Treatment
- Hydration
- Oral chemolitholysis (e.g., potassium citrate) via urine alkalinization 
	- Uric acid stones are unique in that they can usually be dissolved by alkalizing the urine. In other stones, urine alkalinization is used for prophylaxis rather than treatment.
- Low-purine diet
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Allopurinol</span>
>[!Mnemonic] 
>**U**ric acid stones are radiol**U**cent (x-ray negative).

>[!warning] 
>Uricosuric agents (e.g., probenecid) increase the excretion of uric acid, which can accelerate the formation of stones.
## Cystine stones
### Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Autosomal recessive defect in cystine-reabsorbing PCT transporter</span> → impaired proximal renal tubular absorption of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">dibasic amino acids</span> → [[../Biochemistry/Cystinuria|Cystinuria]] → cystine stone formation (as cystine is poorly soluble)
- Develop in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">persistently acidic urine</span>
### Clinical features
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Recurrent kidney stones (manifesting with e.g., flank pain) starting <u>in childhood</u></span>
### Diagnosis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Urine microscopy: hexagonal crystals</span> ![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231106145828.png|Pasted image 20231106145828.png]]
- X-ray (or CT)
	- Weakly radiopaque stones
	- Possibly staghorn calculi
- Positive cyanide nitroprusside test
## Struvite stones (magnesium ammonium phosphate stones)
### Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Upper [[./Urinary tract infections|UTI]] with urease-producing bacteria</span> such as Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and/or Pseudomonas
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">These bacteria convert urea to ammonia → elevated ammonia causing alkaline urine → precipitation of the ammonium magnesium phosphate salt → crystal and stone formation</span>
		- Urea → 2 NH<sub>3</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub>
		- NH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O → NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> + OH<sup>−</sup>
	- Grow rapidly into a branched staghorn calculus that fills the renal calyces and pelvis.
	- Over time, the affected kidney can atrophy due to recurrent infection and chronic obstructive nephropathy.
### Treatment
- Antibiotic treatment of [[./Urinary tract infections|urinary tract infections]]
- Hydration
- Urine acidification
- Usually require surgical stone removal
