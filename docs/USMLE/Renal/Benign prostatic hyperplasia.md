# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is a potent prostatic growth factor.
- Androgen-estrogen imbalance: As men age, testosterone levels decline, but estrogen levels remain the same, which results in a higher estrogen/testosterone ratio.

# Clinical features

# Diagnostics
## Serum [[./Prostate-specific antigen|PSA]] level
- Findings
	- Total [[./Prostate-specific antigen|PSA]] > 1.5 ng/mL: suggests an enlarged prostate (> 40 mL) 
	- Total [[./Prostate-specific antigen|PSA]] > 4 ng/mL: increased likelihood of [[./Prostate cancer|prostate cancer]]
- Free PSA levels and free PSA/total PSA ratio
	- ↑ Free PSA levels and ↑ free PSA/total PSA ratio: usually seen in BPH
	- ↓ Free PSA levels and ↓ free PSA/total PSA ratio: suggestive of [[./Prostate cancer|prostate cancer]]

# Treatment
## Pharmacological therapy
### Uroselective alpha-1 blockers
- Tamsulosin, Doxazosin, Alfuzosin, Terazosin
### 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs)
- See [[../Reproductive/Androgen and estrogen synthesis#Adrenal androgen synthesis|Androgen and estrogen synthesis > Adrenal androgen synthesis]]
- Inhibition of 5-alpha reductase → ↓ conversion of testosterone to DHT → ↓ intraprostatic DHT levels → ↓ prostatic growth and ↑ prostatic apoptosis and involution → improvement of LUTS![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230925162608.png|Pasted image 20230925162608.png]]
- Adverse effects: sexual dysfunction (e.g., erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, ejaculatory dysfunction), gynecomastia
- Finasteride, Dutasteride

>-steride (“testosterone reductase inhibitor”)
### Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE-5 inhibitors)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increase in intracellular [[../Biochemistry/Signal transduction|cGMP]] → ↓ detrusor, prostate, and urethra muscle tone → improvement of LUTS</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tadalafil</span>

# Complications
- Recurrent [[./Urinary tract infections|UTI]] 
	- BPH → incomplete voiding → urinary stasis → predisposition to [[./Urinary tract infections|UTIs]]
- Urinary retention with bladder distension and bladder wall thickening (hypertrophy)
- Bladder calculi
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hydronephrosis</span>
