- Can be used to evaluate <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">urine concentration</span>
- Decrease when urine concentration is damaged (e.g. Intrinsic renal failure)
- More accurate than the dipstick measurement for **[[./Urine specific gravity|urine specific gravity]]** (not affected by large molecules)
- The normal <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">serum osmolality</span> should range from <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">275 to 295 mOsm/kg</span>
