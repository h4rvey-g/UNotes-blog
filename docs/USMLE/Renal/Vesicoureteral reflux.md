# Epidemiology
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Age: children &lt; 2 years</span>

# Etiology
## Primary VUR (most common type)
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Short intramural ureter</span> → vesicoureteric junction (VUJ) fails to close completely during bladder contraction → VUR![[../../assets/img/highresdefault_L87924.jpg|highresdefault_L87924.jpg]]
## Secondary VUR
- Bladder outlet obstruction (anatomic/functional): high pressure within the bladder → reflux of urine through the VUJ![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230823172334.png|Pasted image 20230823172334.png]]
- Anatomic: [[./Posterior urethral valves|posterior urethral valves]] ; urethral meatal stenosis

# Clinical features
- Suspected in the prenatal period when <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hydronephrosis</span> is detected on routine antenatal ultrasound
- Postnatal presentation
	- Recurrent febrile [[./Urinary tract infections|urinary tract infections]]
		- Neonates: irritability, fever, and listlessness
		- Older children: urinary urgency, frequency, incontinence, and dysuria associated with fever
	- Reflux nephropathy : renovascular hypertension, kidney failure, uremia

>[!tip] 
>VUR is generally asymptomatic until it causes a urinary tract infection.

# Treatment
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Spontaneous resolution occurs in most patients with mild VUR, because the intravesical ureter length increases with patient growth.</span>
