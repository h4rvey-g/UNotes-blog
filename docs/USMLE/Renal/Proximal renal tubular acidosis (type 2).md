# Etiology
- Drugs: acetazolamide

---
# Pathophysiology
- Isolated proximal RTA: The proximal convoluted tubule cells are unable to reabsorb HCO3-.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fanconi syndrome</span>: Impaired reabsorption of HCO3- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">and other compounds (e.g., potassium, glucose, phosphate, and amino acid reabsorption)</span> in the PCT

# Clinical features
- Vitamin D-resistant hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia (caused by phosphaturia and hypophosphatemia; individuals with Fanconi syndrome typically have more severe symptoms)
- Short stature
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Polyuria</span> → polydipsia, dehydration
>[!tip] 
>Excessive tubular glucose impairs renal concentrating ability by acting as an osmotic diuretic, contributing to development of polyuria (eg, more wet diapers) and episodes of hypovolemia .  However, plasma glucose is tightly regulated by mechanisms (eg, insulin, glucagon) independent of renal reabsorption.  Therefore, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">serum glucose remains normal.</span>
