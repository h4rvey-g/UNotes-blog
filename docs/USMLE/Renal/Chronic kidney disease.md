## Consequences
### Reduced GFR
- ↓ Production of urine → ↑ extracellular fluid volume → total-body volume overload
- ↓ Excretion of waste products (e.g., urea, drugs)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ Excretion of phosphate → hyperphosphatemia</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">During the early stages of CKD</span>, plasma phosphate levels will typically be normal due to the increased secretion of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23).</span>  
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">FGF23 is produced by osteoblasts in response to initial hyperphosphatemia and increased calcitriol.</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increased secretion of FGF23 leads to increased phosphate secretion and suppressed conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.</span>
		- In advanced CKD, the effects of FGF 23 subside (most likely due to development of resistance in target tissues).
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ Maintenance of acid-base balance  → metabolic acidosis</span>
- ↓ Maintenance of electrolyte concentrations → electrolyte imbalances (e.g., Na+ retention)
### Reduced endocrine activity
- ↓ Hydroxylation of calcifediol → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ production of calcitriol → (in combination with ↓ excretion of phosphate) → ↓ serum Ca2+ → ↑ PTH</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ Erythropoietin → ↓ stimulation of erythropoiesis</span>
