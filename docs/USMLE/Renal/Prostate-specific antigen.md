PSA is a serine protease produced only in the prostate gland and, therefore, is an organ-specific marker. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">It is not cancer-specific however, as levels may also be elevated in benign conditions.</span>
- Indications
	- Suspected [[./Prostate cancer|prostate cancer]]
	- Monitoring for recurrence following treatment of [[./Prostate cancer|prostate cancer]]
- Interpretation
	- Total PSA levels (I.e. free and bound PSA)
		- PSA > 4 ng/mL: [[./Prostate cancer|Prostate cancer]] is likely.
	- Free PSA (unbound) : Free PSA levels are lower in [[./Prostate cancer|prostate cancer]] than in normal prostate tissue or benign disease.
- Other causes of elevated total PSA: [[./Benign prostatic hyperplasia|BPH]], [[./Urinary tract infections|UTI]], prostatitis, prostatic trauma or manipulation (including DRE)

>[!warning] 
>A PSA level â‰¤ 4 ng/mL does not exclude [[./Prostate cancer|prostate cancer]]!

>[!warning] 
>5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) can suppress PSA production, resulting in spuriously low PSA levels. This should be taken into consideration in patients on long-term 5-ARIs (e.g., for [[./Benign prostatic hyperplasia|BPH]]).

>[!tip] 
>Inflammation, manipulation of the prostate, and other malignant and benign prostate diseases may lead to a false-positive PSA result!
