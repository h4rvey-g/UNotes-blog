# Pathophysiology

- Rhabdomyolysis → release of the following substances:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and serum myoglobin → pigment nephropathy → [[./Acute kidney injury|acute tubular necrosis]] → [[./Acute kidney injury|acute kidney injury]] (intrinsic)</span>
	- Potassium → cardiac arrhythmia
	- Lactic acid → metabolic acidosis
- Hypovolemia → ↓ renal perfusion → [[./Acute kidney injury|acute kidney injury]] (prerenal)
	- Hypovolemia is predominantly due to third spacing of extracellular fluid into damaged muscle tissue.
- Reperfusion syndrome → compartment syndrome
