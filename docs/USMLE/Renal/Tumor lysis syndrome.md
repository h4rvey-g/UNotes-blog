# Definition
A <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">potentially life-threatening oncologic emergency</mark> resulting from the rapid destruction of tumor cells, which leads to a massive release of intracellular components, e.g., potassium (K<sup>+</sup>), phosphate (PO43-), and uric acid, that can damage the **kidneys** and cause renal failure.

# Etiology
most commonly <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">occurs after initiating cytotoxic treatment</mark> in patients with hematologic malignancies (e.g., [[../Blood/Acute leukemia|ALL]], [[../Blood/Acute leukemia|AML]], or [[../Blood/Non-Hodgkin lymphomas|NHL]]).most commonly occurs after initiating cytotoxic treatment in patients with hematologic malignancies (e.g., [[../Blood/Acute leukemia|ALL]], [[../Blood/Acute leukemia|AML]], or [[../Blood/Non-Hodgkin lymphomas|NHL]]).

# Pathophysiology
Tumor cell lysis → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">release of intracellular components (e.g., K<sup>+</sup>, PO43-, nucleic acids) into the bloodstream</span>
- ↑ Nucleic acid → conversion to uric acid →<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> [[../MSK/Gout|hyperuricemia]]</span> → urate nephropathy and risk of [[./Acute kidney injury|acute kidney injury]] 
- ↓ Ca<sup>2+</sup> secondary to PO43- binding → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hypocalcemia</span> → neuronal excitability → risk of seizures
- Hyperphosphatemia: PO43- binds Ca<sup>2+</sup> and forms calcium phosphate crystals that obstruct renal tubules → [[./Acute kidney injury|acute kidney injury]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hyperkalemia</span>: changes in resting membrane potential → risk of cardiac arrhythmias

>[!Mnemonic] 
>Think of “<font color="#ffc000">PUKE</font> calcium” to remember the electrolytes affected in tumor lysis syndrome: <font color="#ffc000">P</font>hosphorus, <font color="#ffc000">U</font>ric acid, and potassium (<font color="#ffc000">K+</font>) are <font color="#ffc000">E</font>levated; Calcium is decreased.

# Clinical features
- Renal failure: e.g., edema, lethargy, oliguria
- Hyperkalemia: e.g., cardiac arrhythmias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea
- Hypocalcemia: e.g., tetany, muscle cramps, seizures

# Diagnostics
Hydration is the mainstay of TLS prophylaxis and treatment.

# Treatment
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hydration is the mainstay of TLS prophylaxis and treatment.</span>
- Hyperuricemia
	- Allopurinol
		- Indicated as prophylaxis in patients at low to intermediate risk
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Rasburicase: recombinant uricase</span> that catalyzes the breakdown of uric acid to allantoin 
		- Indications
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Treatment of established TLS</span>
			- Prophylaxis for intermediate to high-risk patients
