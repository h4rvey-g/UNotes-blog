Measures the ratio of urine density over pure water density (normally 1.005â€“1.030) 
- High urine specific gravity: volume loss, [[../Cardiology/Heart failure|heart failure]], presence of large molecules (e.g., glucose, radiocontrast media) 
- Low urine specific gravity: renal failure, [[./Diabetes insipidus|diabetes insipidus]]
