<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Neutrophils infiltrate renal interstitium. Affects cortex with relative sparing of glomeruli/vessels.</span>
# Etiology
- Usually caused by an ascending bacterial infection of the bladder (cystitis)
- Pathogens
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Gram-negative rods</span> bacteria (Thus <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">use fluoroquinolones</span>)
		- Escherichia coli (∼ 75–90% of cases; leading cause of pyelonephritis)
		- Pseudomonas aeruginosa
		- Klebsiella pneumoniae
  - Risk factors
	- Most common in women because they have shorter urethras
	- Pregnancy
	- Urinary tract obstruction (potentially leading to pyonephrosis)
	- Foreign bodies (e.g., indwelling urinary catheters or other urologic instrumentation)
	- Anatomical abnormalities (e.g., [[./Benign prostatic hyperplasia|benign prostatic hyperplasia]], [[./Vesicoureteral reflux|vesicoureteral reflux]], [[./Nephrolithiasis|nephrolithiasis]], ureteral strictures)
	- Immunosuppression (e.g., HIV, [[../Endocrine/Diabetes mellitus|diabetes mellitus]])

# Pathology
## Acute pyelonephritis
- Most commonly affects the cortex (spares glomeruli and vessels)
- Purulent inflammation of the interstitium with destruction of the parenchyma, the renal tubules, and, in some cases, the renal pelvis
- Histology
	- [[../Blood/Polymorphonuclear leukocytes|PMN]] infiltration of the renal tubules and the interstitium ![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230901164549.png|Pasted image 20230901164549.png]]
	- Sparing of the glomeruli and intrarenal vessels
## Chronic pyelonephritis
- Chronic inflammatory changes with rough, asymmetric scarring and fibrosis of the corticomedullary junction 
- Blunted calyces from recurrent urinary reflux
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Histology: eosinophilic casts in the tubules that resemble thyroid tissue with coloid (thyroidization of the kidney)</span> ![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230901172427.png|Pasted image 20230901172427.png]]
- Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis
	- A rare form of chronic pyelonephritis characterized by chronic destructive granuloma formation
	- Associated with Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli infections
	- Large, irregular, yellow-orange masses on gross examination of the kidney (may be mistaken for a true renal neoplasm)
	- Histology: granulomatous tissue with lipid-laden foamy macrophages and multinucleated giant cells![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230901174015.png|Pasted image 20230901174015.png]]

# Clinical features
>[!tip] 
>Suspect pyelonephritis in any patient presenting with fevers, chills, and flank pain, irrespective of lower urinary tract symptoms.

# Diagnostics
## Urinalysis
- Nonspecific findings of [[./Urinary tract infections|UTI]]
	- Pyuria (positive esterase on dipstick test)
	- Leukocyturia (WBCs > 5/hpf)
	- Bacteriuria
	- Positive nitrites on dipstick test indicate bacteria that convert [[../Pharmacology/Nitrates|nitrates]] to nitrites (most commonly gram-negative bacteria; e.g., E.coli).
	- Hematuria (including microhematuria)
- Other findings
	- WBC casts: rare finding, but considered to be a strong indicator for pyelonephritis
