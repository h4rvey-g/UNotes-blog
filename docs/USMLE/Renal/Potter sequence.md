# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- Chronic placental insufficiency
- ↓ Renal output (e.g., due to bilateral renal agenesis, ARPKD, obstruction of posterior urethral valves)
- Chronic amniotic fluid leakage

---
# Pathophysiology
[[../Reproductive/Oligohydramnios|oligohydramnios]] → intrauterine compression and decreased amniotic fluid ingestions → ↓ space for fetal development → internal and external deformations

---
# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pulmonary hypoplasia</span> (cause of death due to severe neonatal respiratory insufficiency)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Craniofacial abnormalities</span> (e.g., prominent epicanthal and infraorbital folds, flattened nose, receding chin, low set ears) 
- Wrinkling of the skin 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Limb anomalies</span> (e.g., bowed legs, clubbed feet)
