### Type I [[./Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis|MPGN]]:
- Electron microscopy: Characterized by the presence of discrete subendothelial electron dense deposits![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230825153718.png|Pasted image 20230825153718.png]]
- Mesangial and occasional subepithelial deposits may also be present
- Immunofluorescence shows IgG, IgM and C3 deposited in a granular pattern and every [[../Immunology/Complement system|complement]] components (C1Q and C4) are often also present indicating are immune complexes pathogenesis
### Type II [[./Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis|MPGN]] (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">more diverse, more dense!</span>)
- Is characterised by deposition of dark, ribbon like electron dense material in the central layer of (Lamina Densa) of glomerular basement membrane![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230825153751.png|Pasted image 20230825153751.png]]
- Immunofluorescence – C3 deposition on both sides of the basement membrane in irregular granular or linear pattern
- C3 can also be identified in mesangium in the ring shaped aggregates

This immunofluorescence pattern shows positivity with antibody to IgG and has a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">smooth, diffuse, linear pattern</span> that is characteristic for deposition of glomerular basement membrane antibody with [[./Goodpasture syndrome|Goodpasture syndrome]].
