# Epidemiology
- Peak incidence: between 2 and 5 years 
- Most common malignant neoplasm of the kidney in children

---
# Etiology
Can be associated with loss-of-function mutations of tumor suppressor genes WT1 or WT2 on chromosome 11 (W11ms tumor).
## Associated syndromes
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">WAGR syndrome</span>: Deletion of the 11p13 band leads to the deletion of the WT1 gene and other genes, such as PAX6. 
	- Nephroblastoma
	- Aniridia 
	- Genitourinary anomalies
		- Pseudohermaphroditism, undescended testes in males (due to gonadal dysgenesis)
		- Early-onset [[./Nephrotic syndrome|nephrotic syndrome]]
	- Range of intellectual disability
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Denys-Drash syndrome</span>: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">a mild form of WAGR without aniridia or intellectual disability.</span>
	- Nephroblastoma
	- Pseudohermaphroditism, undescended testes in males (due to gonadal dysgenesis)
	- Early-onset [[./Nephrotic syndrome|nephrotic syndrome]] caused by diffuse mesangial sclerosis
- Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome: mutations of the WT2 gene

# Pathophysiology

# Clinical features
## Abdominal symptoms
- Palpable abdominal mass (often found incidentally)
	- Non-tender
	- Unilateral and large but not crossing midline 
	- Smooth and firm
- Abdominal pain (∼ 40% of cases)
## Other signs and symptoms
- Hematuria (∼ 25% of cases)
- Hypertension (∼ 25% of cases)

>[!tip] 
>Nephroblastoma should be suspected in a toddler with a non-tender abdominal mass, especially if it is firm, smooth, and associated with hematuria and/or hypertension.

>[!warning] 
>Careless palpation of a nephroblastoma can result in rupture of the renal capsule and tumor spillage!
