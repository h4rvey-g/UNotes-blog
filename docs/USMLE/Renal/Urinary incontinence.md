# Epidemiology
- [[./Stress incontinence|Stress incontinence]] and mixed incontinence are the most common types of incontinence in female patients.
- [[./Urge incontinence|Urge incontinence]] is the most common type in male patients.

---
# Etiology
- Neurological causes
	- [[../Neurology/Multiple sclerosis|Multiple sclerosis]]
	- Spinal injury
	- Normal-pressure hydrocephalus
- Genitourinary causes
	- Trauma to the pelvic floor 
	- Intrinsic sphincter deficiency
	- Urethral hypermobility in women
	- Impaired detrusor contractility
	- Bladder outlet obstruction
	- Pelvic floor weakness
- Transient causes of urinary incontinence
	- Drugs (e.g., diuretics)
	- [[./Urinary tract infections|Urinary tract infections]]
	- Postmenopausal atrophic urethritis
	- Psychiatric causes (especially depression, delirium/confused state)
	- Excessive urinary output (in conditions like hyperglycemia, [[../Cardiology/Hypercalcemia|hypercalcemia]], CHF)
	- Stool impaction
- General risk factors
	- Recurrent [[./Urinary tract infections|urinary tract infections]]

 >[!Mnemonic] 
>To remember the reversible causes of acute urinary incontinence, think DIAPPERS: Delirium/confusion, Infection, Atrophic urethritis/vaginitis, Pharmaceutical, Psychiatric causes (especially depression), Excessive urinary output (hyperglycemia, [[../Cardiology/Hypercalcemia|hypercalcemia]], CHF), Restricted mobility, Stool impaction.

# Classifications
## Overflow incontinence
### Mechanism
- Impaired (weak) detrusor contractility
- Bladder outlet obstruction (e.g., [[./Benign prostatic hyperplasia|BPH]])
- Both mechanisms can lead to incomplete bladder emptying → bladder overfilling → <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">chronically distended bladder with ↑ bladder pressure → dribbling of urine (leak) when intravesical pressure > outlet resistance</mark>
### Clinical features
- Frequent, involuntary intermittent/continuous dribbling of urine in the absence of an urge to urinate
- Occurs only when the bladder is full
- Postvoid residual urine volume *(seen on ultrasound or with catherization)*
### Treatment
- [[./Intermittent catheterization|Intermittent catheterization]]: for scheduled bladder emptying
	- Intermittent -> prevention of catheter-associated [[./Urinary tract infections|UTIs]] and is favored by most patients; indwelling catheters may be considered if necessary.
## ![[./Stress incontinence|Stress incontinence]]
## ![[./Urge incontinence|Urge incontinence]]
## Neurogenic bladder dysfunction
### Mechanism
detrusor sphincter dyssynergia
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Simultaneous contractions of the detrusor muscle and involuntary activation of the urethral sphincter → blockage of bladder outlet</span> → small amounts of urine are pressed through the contracted sphincter muscle → high intravesical pressure along with inappropriate contraction of the urethral sphincter
- Commonly seen in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Neurology/Multiple sclerosis|multiple sclerosis]] and spinal cord injury </span>
### Clinical features
- Voiding and/or storage dysfunction, intermittent voiding, urinary retention
- Irregular, small volume incontinence without an associated urge to void (sometimes referred to as reflex incontinence)
## Total incontinence
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Complete loss of sphincter function (due to previous surgery, nerve damage, metastasis) → Urinary leakage occurs at all times</span>

>[!warning] 
>The use of muscarinic agonists may lead to urinary urgency, while the use of sympathomimetics or [[../Pharmacology/Muscarinic antagonists|muscarinic antagonists]] may lead to urinary retention, especially if there is an untreated outlet obstruction.

>[!tip] 
>No pharmacological therapies are FDA-approved for [[./Stress incontinence|stress incontinence]]; treatment is primarily conservative with surgery.
