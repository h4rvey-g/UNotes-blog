# Epidemiology
major cause of ESRD
- Type 1 [[../Endocrine/Diabetes mellitus|DM]]: Diabetic kidney disease usually occurs approx. 10 years after diagnosis.
- Type 2 [[../Endocrine/Diabetes mellitus|DM]]: may be present at the time of diagnosis

# Etiology

# Pathophysiology
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Chronic hyperglycemia → glycation (also called non-enzymatic glycosylation or NEG) of the basement membrane (protein glycation) → increased permeability and thickening of the basement membrane and stiffening of the efferent arteriole → hyperfiltration (increase in GFR) → increase in intraglomerular pressure  → progressive glomerular hypertrophy, increase in renal size, and glomerular scarring (glomerulosclerosis) → worsening of filtration capacity</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increases sodium resorption in the proximal tubule by the sodium glucose cotransporter</span>, leading to decreased sodium and fluid delivery to the macula densa and subsequent activation of the tubuloglomerular autoregulation system.  
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Subsequent dilation of the afferent arterioles and constriction of the efferent arterioles increases intraglomerular capillary pressure</span>, resulting in an increased glomerular filtration rate (hyperfiltration) and glomerular hypertrophy

# Pathology
- Mesangial expansion
- Glomerular basement membrane thickening
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Glomerulosclerosis</span> (later stages)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Diffuse hyalinization</span> (most common) or
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pathognomonic nodular glomerulosclerosis (Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules)</span>: ![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230823155435.png|Pasted image 20230823155435.png]]
		- Glomerular capillary hypertension and hyperfiltration → increase in mesangial matrix → eosinophilic hyaline material in the area of glomerular capillary loops
		- Can progressively consume the entire glomerulus → hypofiltration (↓ GFR)

# Clinical features
- Patients are usually asymptomatic in the early stages; some may report <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">foamy urine</span>.
- In the later stages, clinical features of chronic kidney disease (e.g., hypertension, volume overload) may be present.

# Diagnostics
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">eGFR can increase in early stage (hyperfiltration), but eventually decline in CKD stage.![[../../assets/img/L15115.jpg|L15115.jpg]]</span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240322221442.png|Pasted image 20240322221442.png]]
