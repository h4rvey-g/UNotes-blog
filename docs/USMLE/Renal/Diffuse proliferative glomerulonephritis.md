# Epidemiology
- Most common and severe manifestation of <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">lupus nephritis in [[../Immunology/Systemic lupus erythematosus|systemic lupus erythematosus]] (SLE)</mark>
- Also seen with [[./IgA nephropathy|IgA nephropathy]] and with other inflammatory, autoimmune, or infectious diseases

---
# Pathophysiology


---
# Clinical features
- Can also be nephritic with nephrotic-range proteinuria (nephritic-[[./Nephrotic syndrome|nephrotic syndrome]])
- Can lead to immune complex [[./Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis|RPGN]]

---
# Diagnostics
- ↓ Serum C3 [[../Immunology/Complement system|complement]] levels
- ANA, anti-dsDNA antibodies
- LM

	- An immunofluorescence pattern containing <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">IgG, IgM, IgA and C3, C1q</span> is highly characteristic of lupus nephritis and is referred to as a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">full-house</span> (三带一对, ie, a poker hand with three of a kind 3 immunoglobulin classes and two of a kind 2 complement components).![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240529112801.png|Pasted image 20240529112801.png]]
	- The full-house pattern reflects the pathogenesis of lupus: loss of immune tolerance to self-antigens (eg, double-stranded DNA) leads to generation of polyclonal autoantibodies that form circulating immune complexes; these deposit in the glomeruli, where they cause local injury by activating the classical complement cascade.
