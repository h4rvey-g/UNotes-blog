# Etiology


---
# Pathophysiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Auto-antibodies against [[../Biochemistry/Collagen|collagen]] type IV</span> in the renal and pulmonary capillary basement membrane
- Possibly triggered by viral infections, lymphoma

# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hemoptysis</span>
- Cough
- Dyspnea
- [[./Nephritic syndrome|Nephritic syndrome]]
	- Usually presents as [[./Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis|RPGN]] type 1
	- Proliferative glomerulonephritis

# Diagnostics
- Anti-GBM antibodies
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hemosiderin-filled macrophages in sputum</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Due to intra-alveolar bleeding. Macrophages that subsequently phagocytose the erythrocytes are called “[[../Cardiology/Heart failure|heart failure]] cells.”</span> 
	- These cells may also be detected in the sputum of patients with pulmonary infarction, [[../MSK/Vasculitides|vasculitis]], or aspiration of blood.
- Iron deficiency [[../Blood/Anemia|anemia]]
