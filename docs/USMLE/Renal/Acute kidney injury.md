# Pathophysiology
## Prerenal
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Decreased blood supply to kidneys (due to hypovolemia, hypotension, or renal vasoconstriction)</span> → failure of renal vascular autoreg<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"></span>ulation to maintain renal perfusion <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">→ decreased GFR → activation of renin-angiotensin system → increased aldosterone release → increased reabsorption of Na<sup>+</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>O → increased [[./Urine osmolality|Urine osmolality]] → secretion of antidiuretic hormone → increased reabsorption of H<sub>2</sub>O and urea</span>
- Creatinine is still secreted in the proximal tubules, so the blood [[./BUN-creatinine ratio|BUN:creatinine ratio]] increases.
## Intrinsic
- Damage to a vascular or tubular component of the nephron → necrosis or apoptosis of tubular cells → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decreased reabsorption capacity of electrolytes</span> (e.g., Na<sup>+</sup>), water, and/or urea (depending on the location of injury along the tubular system) → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased Na<sup>+</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O in the urine</span> → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decreased [[./Urine osmolality|Urine osmolality]]</span>
## Postrenal
## Four phases of AKI
1. Initiating event (kidney injury)
2. Oliguric or anuric phase (maintenance phase)
	- 1–3 weeks
3. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Polyuric/diuretic phase</span>
	- ∼ 2 weeks
	- Glomerular filtration returns to normal, which increases urine production (polyuria), while tubular reabsorption remains disturbed. 
		- Generally, the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">glomeruli recover faster than the tubular system</span>
	- Complications: loss of electrolytes and water (dehydration, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia)
1. Recovery phase

## Acute tubular necrosis
- Epidemiology: causes ∼ 85% of intrinsic AKIs
- Location![[../../assets/img/L43195.jpg|L43195.jpg]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The straight segment of the proximal tubule and the straight segment of the distal tubule (i.e., the thick ascending limb) are particularly susceptible to ischemic damage.</span> 
		- They are in medulla and they have high metabolic activity.
	- The convoluted segment of the proximal tubule is particularly susceptible to damage from toxins.
		- First encounters toxins
- Etiology
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ischemic: Injury occurs secondary to decreased renal blood flow.</span>
		- Severe hypotension, especially in the context of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">shock</span>: hypovolemic (e.g., hemorrhage, severe dehydration), septic, cardiogenic (e.g., [[../Cardiology/Heart failure|heart failure]]), or neurogenic shock
		- Cholesterol embolism (atheroemboli)
	- Toxic: Injury occurs directly due to nephrotoxic substances.
		- Contrast-induced nephropathy
		- Medication: aminoglycosides, cisplatin, amphotericin, lead, ethylene glycol
		- Pigment nephropathy
			- Myoglobinuria due to [[./Rhabdomyolysis and crush syndrome|rhabdomyolysis]] ([[./Rhabdomyolysis and crush syndrome|crush syndrome]])
			- Hemoglobinuria associated with hemolysis
- Diagnostic
