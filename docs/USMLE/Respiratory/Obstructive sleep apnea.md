# Pathophysiology
- Obstruction of the upper airways → apnea → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2), ↑ partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO<sub>2</sub>, also known as hypercapnia)</span>, which leads to:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction → ↑ [[./Pulmonary hypertension|pulmonary hypertension]] → [[./Pulmonary hypertension|cor pulmonale]]</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Sympathetic activity → secondary hypertension</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Respiratory acidosis → renal compensation → increased HCO3 retention and decreased chloride reabsorption </span>

# Diagnostics
>[!tip] 
>In OSA, hypercapnia is usually absent when the patient is awake. This fact explains why<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> arterial blood gases would be mostly normal in a patient with OSA</span>. Therefore, this test is not useful for diagnosis.
