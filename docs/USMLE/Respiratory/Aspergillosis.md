- Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis: a long-term Aspergillus infection of the lung which can manifest as:
	- Aspergilloma: an opportunistic infection of a pre-existing cavitary lesion (e.g. from previous tuberculosis)
	- Chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis: a subacute and semi-invasive form of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis characterized by localized, slowly progressive, inflammatory destruction of lung tissue and commonly associated with alcohol use disorder
