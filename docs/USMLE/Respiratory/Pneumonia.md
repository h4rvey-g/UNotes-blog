# Clinical features
## Typical pneumonia
Typical pneumonia is characterized by a sudden onset of symptoms caused by lobar infiltration.
- Severe malaise
- High fever and chills
- Productive cough with purulent sputum (yellow-greenish)
	- Crackles and bronchial breath sounds on auscultation
	- Decreased breath sounds
	- Enhanced bronchophony, egophony, and tactile fremitus
	- Dullness on percussion 
- Tachypnea and dyspnea (nasal flaring, thoracic retractions)

## Atypical pneumonia
Atypical pneumonia typically has an indolent course (slow onset) and commonly manifests with <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">extrapulmonary symptoms</mark>.
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">Nonproductive, dry cough</mark>
- Dyspnea
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">Auscultation often unremarkable</mark>
- Common extrapulmonary features include fatigue, headaches, sore throat, myalgias, and malaise.

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">This classification does not have a major impact on patient management because it is not always possible to clearly distinguish between typical and atypical pneumonia.</mark>
# Pathogen-specific pneumonia
## Mycoplasma pneumonia
### Microbiology
- Incomplete/absent cell wall (not visible on gram stain) 
- Bacterial membrane stabilized by cholesterol (obtained from host cell)
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">Grows on [[../Infective disease/Eaton agar|Eaton agar]] → “fried egg” appearance</mark>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230806165400.png|Pasted image 20230806165400.png]]
### Epidemiology
- One of the most common causes of atypical pneumonia
- More common in school-aged children and adolescents
- Outbreaks most commonly occur in schools, colleges, prisons, and military facilities.
### Clinical features
- Generalized papular rash
- Erythema multiforme 
- [[Pneumonia#Atypical pneumonia|Pneumonia > Atypical pneumonia]]
### Diagnostics
- Subclinical hemolytic [[../Blood/Anemia|anemia]]: associated with elevated cold agglutinin titers (IgM)
- Interstitial pneumonia, often with a reticulonodular pattern on chest x-ray
- Chest x-ray can show extensive pulmonary involvement in patients with mild pneumonia.
# Aspiration pneumonia
## Definitions
- Aspiration pneumonia: a type of pneumonia that occurs as a result of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">upper airway or stomach microbes (anaerobes) aspiration</span>
- Aspiration pneumonitis
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Aspiration of gastric acid</span> that initially causes tracheobronchitis, with rapid progression to chemical pneumonitis
	- May cause [[./Acute respiratory distress syndrome|ARDS]] in extreme cases
## Clinical features
- Aspiration pneumonitis
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Present hours after aspiration event</span>
	- Range from no symptoms to nonproductive cough, ↓ O2, respiratory distress
	- CXR infiltrates (one or both lower lobes) resolve without antibiotics
- Aspiration pneumonia
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Present days after aspiration event</span>
	- Fever, cough, ↑ sputum
	- CXR infiltrate in dependent lung segment (classically RLL)
	- Can progress to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">abscess</span>
## Diagnostics
Imaging: The lung region in which the infiltrates are seen depends on the patient's position on aspiration.
- Supine position: superior segment of the right lower lobe (most common site of aspiration)
- Standing/sitting: posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe
- Right lateral decubitus position: posterior segment of the right upper lobe or right middle lobe![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230804160535.png|Pasted image 20230804160535.png]]
