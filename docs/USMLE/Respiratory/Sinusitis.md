	 - Impairments of ciliary function such as cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia

# Clinical features
## Subtypes
- Acute viral rhinosinusitis
	- May occur with acute otitis media
	- May manifest with other symptoms of URTI (e.g., sore throat, cough)
- Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis
	- Severe symptoms (including fever > 39°C, facial pain, purulent nasal discharge)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Viral turns to bacterial: Symptoms typically remain stable or improve for 5–6 days and then worsen (double worsening).</span>
