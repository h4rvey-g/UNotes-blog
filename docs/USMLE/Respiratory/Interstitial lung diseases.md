## Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)
- Microscopic findings
	- Patchy areas of interstitial fibrosis with chronic interstitial inflammation intermixed with normal lung
	- Early lesions consist of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">fibroblastic foci that become increasingly collagenous</span> with time![[../../assets/img/L67749.jpg|L67749.jpg]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Honeycomb pattern with fibrotic walls and cystic spaces lined by bronchiolar epithelium</span>
	- Fibrosis most prominent in the subpleural and perilobular regions
## Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP)
- Definition: a rare, type of ILD characterized by inflammation of the bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveolar walls
- Epidemiology
	- Incidence: 1–3 per 100,000 hospital admissions 
	- Affects mostly individuals 40–50 years of age
- Diagnostics: histologically characterized by the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">presence of Masson bodies (granulation tissue buds made of foamy macrophages, mononuclear cells, and fibrous tissue) and chronic patchy interstitial inflammation without fibrosis</span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240319210342.png|Pasted image 20240319210342.png]]
# Pathophysiology
---
- General
	- All types of ILDs share the same basic pathophysiology.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Repeated cycles of tissue injury in the lung parenchyma with aberrant wound healing → collagenous fibrosis → remodeling of the pulmonary interstitium</span>
- Pneumoconiosis: inhalation of dust particles → phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages → destruction of alveolar macrophages, inflammatory reaction → scarring, granuloma formation

# Diagnostics
---
## High-resolution CT (HRCT) chest
- Typical UIP pattern findings 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Honeycombing: multiple cystic lesions within the lung parenchyma due to fibrosis</span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240319210817.png|Pasted image 20240319210817.png]]
	- Irregular thickening of intralobular septa
	- Reticular pattern and mild ground glass opacity (GGO)
	- Traction [[./Bronchiectasis|bronchiectasis]] (irreversible dilatation of the bronchi and bronchioles due to fibrosis)
## Pulmonary function tests (PFTs)
- Restrictive lung disease pattern 
	- ↓ Total lung capacity and ↓ vital capacity
	- Normal or ↓ FEV1
	- ↓ FVC
	- Normal or ↑ FEV1:FVC ratio
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The increased elastic recoil results in increased radial traction (outward pulling) on the airways, leading to increased expiratory flow rates when corrected for the low lung volume.</span>
- Decreased diffusing capacity for CO (DLCO): highly sensitive parameter
