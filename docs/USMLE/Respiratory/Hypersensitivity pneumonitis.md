# Epidemiology
---


# Etiology
---
- Combined [[../Immunology/Type III hypersensitivity reactions|type III hypersensitivity reaction]] and [[../Immunology/Type IV hypersensitivity reaction|type IV hypersensitivity reaction]] with genetic predisposition
- Inhalation of organic particles (< 5 microns), primarily through occupational exposure
- Farmers are frequently affected

# Pathophysiology
---


# Clinical features
---
- Acute 
	- Flu-like symptoms: fever, chills, malaise, cough, headache
	- Dyspnea without wheezing
	- Chest tightness 
	- Diffuse fine crackles and a late inspiratory squawk  upon auscultation 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Symptoms subside within hours to days after removal of the inciting antigen.</span>
- Chronic 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Insidious onset of fatigue, productive cough, progressive dyspnea, cyanosis</span>
	- Bilateral rales
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Weight loss</span>
		- Due to increased respiratory activity

# Diagnostics
---
## High-resolution CT
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Honeycombing</span> (irreversible fibrotic changes) with or without emphysema
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Thickening of alveolar septa</span>
- Traction [[./Bronchiectasis|bronchiectasis]] or bronchiolectasis
- Ground-glass opacities with inspiratory mosaic attenuation
## Lung biopsy
- Supportive findings: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">noncaseating granulomas with lymphocytes and polynuclear giant cells</span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240321111432.png|Pasted image 20240321111432.png]]

Differential diagnostics
- Noncaseating granuloma: vs [[./Sarcoidosis|sarcoidosis]]![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240321112057.png|Pasted image 20240321112057.png]]![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240321112129.png|Pasted image 20240321112129.png]]
- Clinical features and HRCT: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">vs [[./Interstitial lung diseases|idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis]]</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Affected patients are usually older (eg, age >50) and granulomas are not expected on lung biopsy.</span>
