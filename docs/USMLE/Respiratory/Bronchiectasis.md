# Etiology
>[!tip] 
>
> Bronchiectasis requires the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">combination of two important processes</span> taking place in the bronchi: 
> - either <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">local infection</span> 
> - or<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> inflammation along with either inadequate clearance of secretions, airway obstruction, or impaired host defenses</span>. 
> 
> These processes result in the permanent dilation of airways.
- Pulmonary infections (i.e., bacterial, viral, fungal), especially severe or chronic infections 
- Disorders of secretion clearance or mucous plugging
	- [[../Biochemistry/Cystic fibrosis|Cystic fibrosis]] (CF)  (Most common congenital cause of bronchiectasis)
	- [[../Biochemistry/Primary ciliary dyskinesia|Primary ciliary dyskinesia]] (PCD)
	- Allergic bronchopulmonary [[./Aspergillosis|aspergillosis]] (ABPA)
	- [[../Biochemistry/Primary ciliary dyskinesia|Kartagener syndrome]]
	- Smoking: associated with poor ciliary motility
- Bronchial narrowing or other forms of obstruction
	- [[./Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]]
	- Aspiration
	- Tumors
- Immunodeficiency (e.g., common variable immunodeficiency, hypogammaglobulinemia, [[../Infective disease/Human immunodeficiency virus|HIV]])

# Pathophysiology


---
# Clinical features
- Chronic productive cough (lasting months to years) with copious mucop<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"></span>urulent sputum
	- The sputum may be green or yellow in color.
- Auscultation
	- Crackles and rhonchi
	- Wheezing
- Dyspnea
- Hemoptysis
- Exacerbations of bronchiectasis
    - Recurrent bouts of [[./Pneumonia|pneumonia]] and acute bacterial infection of sections of dilated bronchi
    - Frequently due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa
    - Features
        - Increased production of mucous above baseline
        - Low-grade fever

> [!NOTE] Note
> <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bronchiectasis should be suspected in patients with a chronic cough that produces large amounts of sputum.</span>

# Diagnostics
>[!tip] 
>In patients with suspected bronchiectasis, diagnosis is confirmed using imaging studies, preferably a HRCT scan. Additional diagnostic studies are useful to identify the underlying cause and possibly provide specific treatment.
## Imaging
High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) chest: confirmatory test
- Bronchial dilation
	- **Cylindrical or tubular (most common) : parallel tram track sign and signet ring sign**  ![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230804144028.png|Pasted image 20230804144028.png]]
	- Varicose 
	- Saccular or cystic (most severe form) 
	- Bronchial dilation can be identified with a bronchial/arterial ratio > 1
- Thickened bronchial walls, mucus plugging, honeycombing (suggests late-stage bronchiectasis)

---
# Treatment
## General measures
- Smoking cessation
- Bronchopulmonary hygiene and chest physiotherapy: e.g., cupping and clapping, postural drainage, directed cough, hydration
- Administer vaccinations (i.e., seasonal [[../Infective disease/Influenza|influenza]] vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine).
