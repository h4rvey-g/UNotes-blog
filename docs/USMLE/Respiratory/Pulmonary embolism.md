# Pathophysiology

- The lung is supplied by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">dual circulation from both the pulmonary arteries and bronchial arteries.</span> This collateral circulation can help protect against lung infarction as a complication of pulmonary embolism (PE).
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Distal PEs in small arteries (≤3 mm) are more likely to cause infarction</span> as they may occlude areas distal to the pulmonary-bronchial anastomoses.  
- When a pulmonary infarction does occur, it is typically hemorrhagic (red) rather than ischemic (white) due to the relatively low density of lung tissue and the dual blood supply.
# ECG
ECG changes may be due to right ventricular strain and pressure overload.
Most common findings 
- T-wave inversions or flattening
- Sinus tachycardia 
- Normal ECG
- S<sub>1</sub>Q<sub>3</sub>T<sub>3</sub> pattern (neither sensitive nor specific)![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230808202409.png|Pasted image 20230808202409.png]]
Predictors of adverse outcomes: See “High-risk ECG findings in PE.”
Other ECG findings in PE: sinus bradycardia (< 60/min); uncommon) 
# Treatment
---
## Reperfusion therapy
- Indications
	- Massive PE (hemodynamic instability and/or right heart failure) with a low bleeding risk
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), e.g., alteplase (preferred)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Endothelial-derived TPA is limited primarily to the bronchial circulation, and spontaneous recanalization of the pulmonary artery is a slow process.</span>
