>When oxygen supply is insufficient, the body initially reduces the affinity of red blood cells for oxygen, ensuring adequate oxygen supply to peripheral tissues.
- Causes of shift to the right include:
	- ↑ Partial pressure of carbon dioxide (↑ PCO<sub>2</sub>) 
	- ↑ Body temperature (e.g., fever)
	- ↑ H<sup>+</sup> (↓ pH)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ 2,3-BPG (generated by 2,3-BPG mutase during erythrocyte [[../Biochemistry/Glycolysis|glycolysis]])</span>
		- 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) concentrations <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increase in erythrocytes when oxygen availability is reduced</span>, as occurs in chronic lung disease, [[../Cardiology/Heart failure|heart failure]], and chronic exposure to high altitudes.
	- ↑ Exercise
	- ↑ Altitude
- Causes of shift to the left include:
	- ↓ Partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO<sub>2</sub>)
	- ↓ Body temperature
	- ↓ H<sup>+</sup> (↑ pH)
	- ↓ 2,3-BPG (e.g., due to mutations in the BPGM gene on chromosome 7) 
	- ↑ CO
	- ↑ Methemoglobin
	- ↑ Fetal hemoglobin (HbF)
