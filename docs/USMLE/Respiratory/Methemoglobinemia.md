# Epidemiology

# Etiology
---
- nitrites

# Pathophysiology
---
- Methemoglobin is created when reduced ferrous iron (Fe2+) bound to oxyhemoglobin is oxidized to ferric iron (Fe3+).
- Ferric iron in methemoglobin cannot bind oxygen→ ↓ total blood oxygen content and ↓ blood oxygen saturation → tissue hypoxia
>[!tip] 
>The ferric iron in methemoglobin has a high affinity for cyanide, thus, amyl nitrite-induced <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">methemoglobin is used as a competitive inhibitor in the treatment of [[../Blood/Cyanide poisoning|cyanide poisoning]].</span>
# Clinical features

# Treatment

- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Methylene blue is the first-line treatment for acquired methemoglobinemia.</span>
	- Acts as a cofactor to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">reduce methemoglobin to hemoglobin</span>
