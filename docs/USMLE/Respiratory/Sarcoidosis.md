# Etiology

# Pathophysiology
Sarcoidosis is a systemic disorder characterized by widespread, immune-mediated formation of <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">noncaseating granulomas</mark>.
- General
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Inhalation of foreign antigen</span> → monocyte differentiation → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">activation of interstitial dendritic cells and alveolar macrophages</span>
	- Interstitial dendritic cells migrate towards mediastinal lymph nodes and alveolar macrophages differentiate, serving as antigen-presenting cells to circulating T helper (Th) cells → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">differentiation and clonal expansion of T cells</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">T cell recruitment and ↑ B-cell activity → local immune hyperactivity and inflammation → formation of noncaseating granulomas in the lungs and the lymphatic system</span>
- Granuloma formation
	- A nodular collection of macrophages that forms as a result of inflammation without central necrosis. Associated with sarcoidosis, berylliosis, and [[../GI/Crohn disease|Crohn disease]].

- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fibrosis</span>: Epithelioid cells secrete cytokines to recruit fibroblasts, leading to fibrosis → damage of organs and tissue
- Calcium dysregulation: activated pulmonary alveolar macrophages → ↑ 1-alpha hydroxylase expression and activity → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) → hypervitaminosis D → hyperphosphatemia, [[../Cardiology/Hypercalcemia|hypercalcemia]], and, possibly, renal failure</span>

# Clinical features
## Pulmonary sarcoidosis
- Lungs are the most commonly affected organ (90% of affected individuals).
- Often asymptomatic in the early stages
- Classic finding is hilar lymphadenopathy![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230803213638.png|Pasted image 20230803213638.png]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Interstitial fibrosis</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cough, exertional dyspnea, chest pain</span>
	- Mild rales on pulmonary auscultation
## Cutaneous sarcoidosis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../MSK/Erythema nodosum|Erythema nodosum]]</span>: most common nonspecific cutaneous manifestation 
![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230720153101.png|Pasted image 20230720153101.png]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lupus pernio</span>
	- A pathognomonic manifestation of sarcoidosis characterized by extensive, violaceous skin plaques (i.e., epithelioid granulomas of the dermis) on the nose, cheeks, chin, and/or ears

# Diagnostics
>[!tip] 
>Increased ACE levels may be seen. However, they are not specific for sarcoidosis and should not be used in isolation for diagnosis or monitoring.

## Imaging
- Chest x-ray
	- Preferred initial test for all patients with suspected sarcoidosis
	- Classic findings: bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy with or without pulmonary infiltrates (i.e., reticular and/or ground glass opacities)![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20230803213638.png|Pasted image 20230803213638.png]]![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240109153322.png|Pasted image 20240109153322.png]]
## Biopsy
- Schaumann bodies: cellular inclusion bodies consisting of intracytoplasmic calcium and protein with laminar stratification (e.g., sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, [[../GI/Crohn disease|Crohn disease]], berylliosis)![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231103144254.png|Pasted image 20231103144254.png]]
## Additional studies
