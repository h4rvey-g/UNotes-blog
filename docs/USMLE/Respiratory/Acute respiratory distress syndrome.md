ARDS is a clinical syndrome of acute respiratory failure characterized by hypoxemia and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates that cannot be fully accounted for by [[../Cardiology/Heart failure|heart failure]] or fluid overload.
# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- Systemic causes
	- Sepsis (most common cause), e.g., secondary to trauma, infection or peritonitis
	- Trauma
	- Shock
	- Massive [[../Blood/Transfusion|transfusion]] 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../GI/Acute pancreatitis|Acute pancreatitis]]</span>
- Primary damage to the lungs
	- [[./Pneumonia|Pneumonia]]
	- Aspiration
	- Inhaled toxins
	- Drowning incidents

# Diagnostics
## Berlin criteria for ARDS
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Acute onset</span>: respiratory failure within one week of a known predisposing factor (e.g., sepsis, [[./Pneumonia|pneumonia]]) or worsening respiratory symptoms
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bilateral opacities (on chest x-ray or CT)</span>
	- Similar appearance to pulmonary edema
	- Not sufficiently explained by pleural effusions, lobar or lung collapse, or nodules
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypoxemia: PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 300 mm Hg</span> (measured with a minimum of 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O PEEP)
	- Mild ARDS: PaO2/FiO2 = 201–300 mm Hg
	- Moderate ARDS: PaO2/FiO2 = 101–200 mm Hg
	- Severe ARDS: PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 100 mm Hg
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Respiratory failure cannot be fully accounted for by [[../Cardiology/Heart failure|heart failure]] or fluid overload.</span>
