## [[../Cardiology/Hypercalcemia|Hypercalcemia]] of malignancy
- Etiology
	- Humoral [[../Cardiology/Hypercalcemia|hypercalcemia]] of malignancy (pseudohyperparathyroidism): [[../Renal/Parathyroid hormone-related protein|PTHrP]] secretion by the tumor
		- Squamous cell carcinomas (lung, head, and neck)
	- Ectopic vitamin D production due to 1Î±-hydroxylase activity in tumor cells
		- [[../Blood/Hodgkin lymphoma|Hodgkin lymphoma]]
		- [[../Blood/Non-Hodgkin lymphomas|NHL]]
	- Local osteolytic [[../Cardiology/Hypercalcemia|hypercalcemia]]: osteolytic activity at sites of skeletal metastases
