## Pulmonary arterial hypertension (Group 1 PH)
- Idiopathic
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hereditary (e.g., BMPR2 loss-of-function mutation)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Encodes a set of inhibitors of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation</span>
	- Associated with a poor prognosis
- Drug-induced
	- Methamphetamine (and possibly amphetamines and cocaine)
- Associated conditions
	- Connective tissue diseases, e.g., [[../MSK/Systemic sclerosis|systemic sclerosis]]
	- Portopulmonary hypertension
	- Congenital heart disease (e.g., left-to-right shunt, Eisenmenger syndrome)
	- [[../Infective disease/Human immunodeficiency virus|HIV]] infection

## Group 1 PH: PAH
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Cardiology/Calcium Channel|Calcium channel]] blockers: First-line pulmonary vasodilator therapy for patients with PAH and positive vasoreactivity testing</span>
- Other pulmonary vasodilator therapies: typically second-line agents, the choice of which depends on symptom severity![[../../assets/img/L40510.jpg|L40510.jpg]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Endothelin receptor antagonists</span> (e.g., bosentan, macitentan, ambrisentan)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Competitively inhibit endothelin-1 receptors → ↓ vasoconstriction in the pulmonary circuit</span>
	- [[../Pharmacology/Phosphodiesterase inhibitors|Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors]] (e.g., sildenafil)
		- PDE5 inhibition → ↓ breakdown of cGMP → pulmonary vasodilation, penile smooth muscle relaxation, and ↑ blood flow
	- Prostacyclin analogs (iloprost, treprostinil) OR Synthetic prostacyclin (epoprostenol)
		- Prostacyclin (PGI2) acts as a direct vasodilator (systemic and pulmonary) and inhibits platelet aggregation via prostacyclin receptors.
		- Receptor binding of prostacyclins or prostacyclin analogs → ↑ intracellular cAMP → inhibition of myosin light chain kinase → vascular smooth muscle relaxation
