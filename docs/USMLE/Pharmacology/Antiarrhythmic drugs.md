# Class I antiarrhythmics
![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240317145409.png|Pasted image 20240317145409.png]]
The key here is to separate the effects of sodium channels and potassium channels. 
1. Sodium channel blockage = slow depolarization + wide QRS + long QT
2. Potassium channel blockage = prolonged APD + prolonged ERP. Both of these blocking effects can treat rapid cardiac arrhythmias. 
Class IA is 1+2, Class IC is only 1 (strongly). However, Class IB is different from the first two as it promotes potassium outflow, thus shortening APD and ERP and increasing ERP:APD ratio
# Class III antiarrhythmics
## Amiodarone
>[!tip] 
>Amiodarone has both Class I, II, III & IV actions!
### Pharmacodynamics
- Primary mechanism of action: antiarrhythmic effect via blockage of voltage-gated potassium channels → prolonged repolarization of the cardiac action potential
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Secondary mechanism of action: inhibits β-receptors and sodium and calcium channels → decreases conduction through the AV and sinus node</span>
- Special uses: only antiarrhythmic agent with (almost) no negative inotropic effect → use in patients with reduced EF

## Adenosine
- Mechanism of action: activates Gi protein → inhibition of adenylate cyclase → ↓ cAMP → deactivation of L-type Ca2+ channels and activation of K+ channels → ↓ Ca2+ and ↑ K+ efflux → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hyperpolarization → transient AV node block (short-acting, ∼ 15 seconds) → acute termination of supraventricular tachycardia</span>
- Indications
	- Diagnosis and termination of certain forms of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias (e.g., AVNRT and orthodromic AVRT) 
	- Diagnosis of underlying AFib in supraventricular tachyarrhythmias
