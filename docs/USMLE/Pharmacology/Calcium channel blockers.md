>- Smooth muscle: stimulus opens L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in the sarcolemma  → influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular space into the smooth muscle cell (Ca2+ is also released from the SR, further increasing the intracellular concentration of Ca2+)
>- Cardiac muscle: AP originating from the cardiac pacemaker cells → muscle cell depolarization that diffuses across the sarcolemma and into T-tubules → short, rapid influx of sodium; prolonged Ca2+ influx (via L-type Ca2+ channels) → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release from the SR</span>  → increased intracellular Ca2+

# Adverse effects
## Nondihydropyridines
- Reduced contractility
	- Verapamil decreases the amount of intracellular calcium available for excitation-contraction coupling within cardiac myocytes.  This reduces myocardial contractility, which can be harmful in patients with impaired ventricular function.
