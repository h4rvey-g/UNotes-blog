# Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
---
## Agents
Acetazolamide
## Mechanism of action
- Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase  in the following organs:
	- Kidney (in the proximal convoluted tubule): → ↑ H+ reabsorption and inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange → ↑ NaHCO3 diuresis and ↑ HCO3- elimination  → compensatory hyperventilation; disinhibition of central chemoreceptors → ↑ oxygenation 
	- Eyes: ↓ production of aqueous humor
	- Brain: ↓ CSF production
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Acid-base effects: alkalinizes urine and acidifies blood</span>

## Mechanism of action
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Inhibition of Na<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>-</sup> cotransporters  in the early distal convoluted tubule</span>  → ↑ excretion of Na<sup>+</sup> (saluresis) and Cl<sup>-</sup> → ↓ diluting capacity of nephron and ↑ excretion of potassium (kaliuresis) and ↓ excretion of calcium  → diuresis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increased reabsorption of Ca<sup>2+</sup></span>
	- Decreased intracellular sodium levels <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increase the activity of the basolateral Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger in the cells of the distal convoluted tubule. Sodium is transported into, and calcium out of, the cell, resulting in decreased intracellular calcium concentration that leads to increased reabsorption from the lumen via luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels.</span> Calcium reabsorption may also be increased because of increased uptake of sodium and calcium in the proximal tubule as a result of sodium depletion.
# Loop diuretics

## Mechanism of action
- Blockage of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-2Cl<sup>-</sup>cotransporter  in the thick ascending loop of Henle
	- Diminishing concentration gradient between the (usually hypertonic) renal medulla and the cortex → concentration of urine is no longer possible → increased diuresis
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Decreased reabsorption of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg2+</span>
		- Normally, Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-2Cl<sup>-</sup>cotransporter can cause positive potential in lumen because of K<sup>+</sup> channel, which drives calcium out of lumen![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240322220231.png|Pasted image 20240322220231.png]]
- Increased PGE release (can be inhibited by NSAIDs)
	- Dilation of renal afferent arterioles → diuresis
	- General venodilation (rapid venous pooling) → ↓ cardiac preload
# Adverse effects

## Loop diuretics
- Hypokalemia
- [[../Renal/Hypomagnesemia|Hypomagnesemia]]
- Hypocalcemia
- Ototoxicity
## Thiazide diuretics
- Hypokalemia
- Hyponatremia
- [[../MSK/Gout|Hyperuricemia]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Cardiology/Hypercalcemia|Hypercalcemia]]</span>
## Potassium sparing diuretics
- All: hyperkalemia
- Spironolactone: gynecomastia, antiandrogen effects
## Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
- [[../Biochemistry/Hyperammonemia|Hyperammonemia]] with paresthesias 
- Proximal [[../Renal/Renal tubular disorders|renal tubular acidosis]] → hyperchloremic, nonanion gap metabolic acidosis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypokalemia</span>
	- Caused by increased sodium delivery to the distal nephron and its reabsorption there in exchange for potassium.
- Sulfonamide hypersensitivity
- Calcium phosphate stone formation (alkaline urine promotes precipitation)
	- Because paracellular calcium (Ca2+) reabsorption is coupled to Na+ reabsorption in the proximal tubule, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">urinary Ca2+ excretion is slightly increased (total serum Ca2+ is slightly reduced).</span>
## Osmotic diuretics
- Hypernatremia
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pulmonary edema</span>
	- Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic, it increases osmolarity of blood and extracts fluid from intracellular compartments into Extracellular compartment. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">This leads to ECF expansion, and volume overload before diuresis begins</span>.
