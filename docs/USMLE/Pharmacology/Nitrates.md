# Adverse effects
- Circulatory dysregulation: hypotension, reflex sympathetic activity → reflex tachycardia → nitrate syncope
	- Beta blockers can be applied to counter this mechanism
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Nitrate-induced headache (due to the dilation of the cerebral arteries)</span>
- Development of tolerance 
	- Prevention: intermittent therapy with nitrate-free intervals of at least 8 hours
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cyanide toxicity after sodium nitroprusside infusion (see [[../Blood/Cyanide poisoning|cyanide poisoning]])</span>
