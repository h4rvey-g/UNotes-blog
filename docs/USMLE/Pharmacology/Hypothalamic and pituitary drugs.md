# GnRH agonists
## Agents
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Buserelin</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Leuprolide</span>
- Nafarelin
- Histrelin
## Mechanism of action
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Initially, the GnRH receptor agonist effect stimulates the HPO axis; this causes increased FSH and estrogen secretion</span> without a significant change in GnRH levels.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">With prolonged use, leuprolide causes desensitization and downregulation of pituitary GnRH receptors, which eventually leads to low FSH and estrogen levels.</span>  Because leuprolide is an exogenous GnRH analogue, its prolonged use also decreases endogenous GnRH levels.
