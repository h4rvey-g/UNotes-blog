### Intracellular potassium deficit
- As a result of hyperglycemic hyperosmolality, potassium shifts along with water from inside cells to the extracellular space and is lost in the urine.
- Insulin normally promotes cellular potassium uptake but is absent in DKA, compounding the problem.
- A total body potassium deficit develops in the body, although serum potassium may be normal or even paradoxically elevated.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Insulin deficiency → hyperosmolality → K<sup>+</sup> shift out of cells + lack of insulin to promote K<sup>+</sup> uptake → intracellular K<sup>+</sup> depleted → total body K<sup>+</sup> deficit despite normal or even elevated serum K<sup>+</sup></span>
>[!tip] 
><span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">There is a total body potassium deficit in DKA.</span> This becomes important during treatment, when insulin replacement leads to rapid potassium uptake by depleted cells and patients may require potassium replacement.
## HHS
- Primarily affects patients with type 2 [[./Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]]
- The pathophysiology of HHS is similar to that of DKA.
- However, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">in HHS, there are still small amounts of insulin being secreted by the pancreas, and this is sufficient to prevent DKA by suppressing lipolysis and, in turn, [[../Biochemistry/Ketone body synthesis|ketogenesis]]. </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">HHS is characterized by symptoms of marked dehydration (and loss of electrolytes) due to the predominating hyperglycemia and osmotic diuresis.</span>

# Diagnostics
>[!tip] 
>- DKA is the diagnosis in patients with [[./Diabetes mellitus|type 1 diabetes]] who have hyperglycemia, ketonuria, and high anion gap metabolic acidosis with decreased bicarbonate!
>- HHS is the diagnosis in patients with [[./Diabetes mellitus|type 2 diabetes]] who have hyperglycemia and hyperosmolality!
## Electrolytes and renal function
- Sodium:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hyponatremia is common in both DKA and HHS, due to hypovolemic hyponatremia  and hypertonic hyponatremia </span>
		- Uncontrolled high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) in DKA acts like a magnet for water.
		- This extra sugar in the blood pulls water out of cells, causing them to shrink.
		- While the total body water stays the same, the concentration of sodium in the remaining extracellular fluid (outside the cells) gets diluted.
	- Always check corrected sodium for hyperglycemia.

# Treatment
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fluid resuscitation: initially with isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl)</span>
- Potassium repletion: for potassium level < 5.3 mEq/L 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Insulin therapy: initiate short-acting insulin once potassium level is > 3.3 mEq/L</span>
- Identify and treat precipitating causes (e.g., sepsis).
