# Epidemiology
- Diabetic [[../Neurology/Polyneuropathy|polyneuropathy]] is the most common form of [[../Neurology/Polyneuropathy|polyneuropathy]] in high-income countries.

---
# Etiology


---
# Pathophysiology
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Chronic hyperglycemia causes glycation of axon proteins</span> and subsequent development of progressive sensomotor neuropathy; typically affects multiple peripheral nerves.

---
# Clinical features
## Diabetic peripheral neuropathy
- Sensory symptoms
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Distal symmetrical sensory loss</span>: stocking glove sensory loss pattern with proximal progression
	- Numbness
	- Tingling
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dysesthesia (e.g., burning feet syndrome with symptoms that worsen at night)</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Motor weakness: e.g., ataxia</span>, balance issues
- Neurological examination may show loss or reduction of:
	- Vibration sense (using a tuning fork)
## Diabetic autonomic neuropathy
### Gastrointestinal autonomic neuropathy
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Painless, watery diarrhea</span>
- Secretory-like (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">persists at night & while [[../Biochemistry/Metabolic fuel use|fasting]]</span>)
- Laboratory evaluation typically unremarkable
### Genitourinary autonomic neuropathy
- Sexual dysfunction (e.g., erectile dysfunction)
- Neurogenic bladder, e.g.:
	- Urinary retention
	- Incomplete bladder emptying
	- Bladder distention
	- Overflow incontinence
	- Poor urinary stream
### Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy
- Early: decreased heart variability
- Late:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Orthostatic hypotension</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tachycardia at rest</span>
		- due to unopposed sympathetic nerve activity

>[!warning] 
>Patients with cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy are at increased risk for silent myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and death.
### Other autonomic neuropathies 
- Impaired pupillary tone
