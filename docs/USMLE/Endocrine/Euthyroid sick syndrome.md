- Description
	- A change in thyroid hormone levels (typically decreased) that <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">occurs in severe illness or severe physical stress</span>
	- Common in intensive care patients and associated with morbidity and mortality
	- Also known as euthyroid sick syndrome (ESS)
- Pathophysiology: multifactorial and not fully understood 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Thyroid gland function typically remains normal.</span>
	- Cytokines (e.g., interleukin 6) are thought to cause various changes in levels of circulating TSH and thyroid hormones.
	- Altered deiodinase enzyme activity leads to:
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ Conversion of T4 to T3</span>
		- ↑ Conversion of T4 to reverse T3 (rT3) by thyroxine 5-monodeiodinase
	- Various factors, e.g., protein loss due to nephrotic syndrome, may also lead to decreased levels of thyroid-binding globulin.
- Clinical features
	- Signs and symptoms of the underlying illness
	- Typically no classic symptoms of hyper- or hypothyroidism
- Diagnostics
	- Early: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Low T3, normal TSH & T4</span>
	- Late: Low T3, TSH & T4
