- Parathyroid gland adenoma (∼ 85%): benign tumor of the parathyroid glands

## Complications
### Osteitis fibrosa cystica (OFC)
- A rare skeletal disorder seen in advanced hyperparathyroidism characterized by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">replacement of calcified bone with fibrous tissue</span>
- Most commonly seen in primary hyperparathyroidism but can also occur in secondary hyperparathyroidism
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ PTH → ↑ RANK ligand expression → activation of osteoclasts → bone resorption, cortical bone destruction, and fibrous tissue deposition</span>
- Features include bone pain, subperiosteal thinning, and bone cysts; multiple bone cysts in the skull may result in a salt and pepper skull (pepper pot) appearance on x-ray.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">In advanced OFC, large, cystic, vascular cavities with a tumor-like appearance on x-ray and a brown color due to hemosiderin deposition (brown tumors) can form in long bones.</span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231003162733.png|Pasted image 20231003162733.png]]
