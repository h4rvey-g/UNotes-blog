- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Alert and oriented patients</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Oral glucose 15â€“20 g </span>
	- Fast-acting carbohydrates (e.g., glucose tablets, candy, or fruit juice)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Patients with altered mental status (or impaired oral intake) </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">IV dextrose</span> (e.g., D50W): Repeat after 15 minutes if hypoglycemia persists; multiple doses may be required. 
		- Adults: 50% dextrose
		- Children (excluding neonates): 10% dextrose OR 25% dextrose
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">IM glucagon: if neither oral nor IV routes of administering glucose are feasible</span>
		- Glucagon therapy is only successful if the patient's glycogen reserves have not been depleted, as glucagon elevates endogenous glucose production via hepatic glycogenolysis and [[../Biochemistry/Gluconeogenesis|gluconeogenesis]].

>[!tip] 
>For patients with [[./Diabetes mellitus|type 1 diabetes]] presenting with hypoglycemia and using insulin pumps, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">do not discontinue insulin pumps</span> and treat hypoglycemia as usual. Removing the insulin pump puts patients at risk for [[./Hyperglycemic crises|diabetic ketoacidosis]].

>[!warning] 
>Avoid giving orange juice to patients with [[../Renal/Chronic kidney disease|CKD]] on a low-potassium diet as it is high in potassium.
