# Epidemiology
- Most common cause of [[./Hyperthyroidism|hyperthyroidism]] in the United States

---
# Etiology
- Genetic predisposition
	- 50% of patients with Graves disease have a family history of autoimmune disorders (e.g., type 1 [[./Diabetes mellitus|diabetes mellitus]], Hashimoto disease, pernicious [[../Blood/Anemia|anemia]], [[../MSK/Myasthenia gravis|myasthenia gravis]])
	- Associated with [[../Immunology/HLA system|HLA-DR3]] and HLA-B8 alleles
- Autoimmunity: B and T [[../Blood/Lymphocyte|lymphocyte]]-mediated disorder
- Triggers
	- Infectious agents: Yersinia enterocolitica and Borrelia burgdorferi have been shown to trigger antigen mimicry for homologies between their protein constituents and thyroid autoantigens.
	- Stress 
		- Stress causes cortisol-mediated immune suppression, which is often <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">followed by rebound immunologic hyperactivity</span> and can trigger Graves disease in genetically susceptible individuals.
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Physical: surgery, trauma</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Psychological</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Reproductive/Pregnancy|Pregnancy]]</span>
		- Thyroid overstimulation by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">high levels of [[../Reproductive/Human chorionic gonadotropin|hCG]] and TRAb</span> during the first trimester increases the risk of Graves disease in the first trimester of pregnancy. In the second trimester, the risk decreases due to progesterone-induced immunosuppression. The risk of Graves disease increases postpartum in susceptible patients due to a drop in progesterone level which leads to the rebound of the immune system that can trigger autoimmunity.

# Pathophysiology
![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231127214913.png|Pasted image 20231127214913.png]]
- General mechanism: B and T cell-mediated autoimmunity → production of stimulating immunoglobulin G <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">(IgG) against TSH-receptor (TRAb</span>; type II hypersensitivity reaction) → ↑ thyroid function and growth → [[./Hyperthyroidism|hyperthyroidism]] and diffuse [[./Goiter|goiter]]
- Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">TSH receptor is also present on fibroblasts in eyes</span>
	- Activated B and T cells infiltrate retro-orbital space targeting orbital fibroblasts → cytokine release (e.g. TNF-α, IFN-γ) → local inflammatory response → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">stimulates fibroblasts to secrete glycosaminoglycans (hyaluronic acid), which also pulls water into the interstitial space (osmotic effect)</span> → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">expansion of retro-orbital tissue</span> due to increased fluid in extraocular muscles, lymphocytic infiltration, and adipogenesis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pretibial myxedema: dermal fibroblast stimulation and deposition of glycosaminoglycans in connective tissue</span>
>[!tip] 
>Although the majority of symptoms are due to increased thyroid hormone levels, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">myxedema ([[./Nonpitting edema|nonpitting edema]]) and exophthalmos</span> in patients with Graves disease are instead due to autoantibody-mediated activation of TSH receptors on peripheral tissue. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Therefore they are not seen on other [[./Hyperthyroidism|Hyperthyroidism]] diseases.</span>

# Diagnostics

# Pathology
- Microscopic: histological features of an overactive gland
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Diffuse hyperplasia of thyroid follicles</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tall, hyperplastic and hypertrophic follicular cells</span>
	- Colloid reabsorption with peripheral scalloping

# Treatment
- Graves ophthalmopathy
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">High-dose IV steroids</span>
		- Glucocorticoids decrease the severity of inflammation and reduce the excess extraocular volume.
