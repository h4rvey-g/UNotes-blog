## Autonomous aldosterone secretion and hypertension
- Physiological aldosterone secretion is regulated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and occurs in response to the detection of low blood pressure in the kidneys (see “Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system”).
- ↑ Aldosterone → ↑ open Na<sup>+</sup> channels in principal cells of luminal membrane at the cortical collecting ducts of the kidneys → ↑ Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption and retention → water retention → hypertension
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Aldosterone escape</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Definition: Evasion of the Na<sup>+</sup>-retaining effects of inappropriately elevated aldosterone levels in primary hyperaldosteronism</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Mechanism: sodium and water retention → volume expansion → secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and pressure natriuresis → compensatory diuresis → “escape” from edema formation and hypernatremia</span>
## Hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis
- ↑ Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption → electronegative lumen → electrical gradient through open K<sup>+</sup> channels → ↑ K<sup>+</sup> secretion → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hypokalemia</span>
- Hypokalemia → metabolic alkalosis via two mechanisms (both of which decrease extracellular H<sup>+</sup>sup>+</sup>, thereby <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increasing extracellular pH</span>):
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Efflux of K<sup>+</sup> from intracellular to extracellular space in exchange for H<sup>+</sup></span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ H<sup>+</sup> secretion in the kidney in order to enable ↑ K<sup>+</sup> reabsorption</span>
- [[../Renal/Diabetes insipidus|Diabetes insipidus]]: hypokalemia → desensitization of renal tubules to antidiuretic hormone (ADH) → polyuria and polydipsia

# Diagnostics

# Differential diagnostics
### Secondary hyperaldosteronism
- Etiology
	- Renal artery stenosis (e.g., due to [[../Cardiology/Atherosclerosis|atherosclerosis]], fibromuscular dysplasia)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Renin-secreting tumor</span>
	- Chronic kidney disease
	- Advanced CHF
	- Fibromuscular dysplasia
	- Liver [[../GI/Cirrhosis|cirrhosis]]
	- Diuretics
	- Laxative abuse
- Diagnostics: ↑ PAC (Plasma aldosterone concentration) and ↑ PRA (Plasma renin activity)

# Treatment
- Unilateral disease or adrenal carcinoma: surgery preferred
- Bilateral disease: medical management preferred
	- Bilateral adrenalectomy has a low success rate for curing hypertension and also leaves the patient dependent on lifelong glucocorticoid replacement; for this reason, medical management is recommended for bilateral disease.
## Medical management
- First-line: aldosterone receptor antagonists
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Spironolactone (preferred)</span>
	- Eplerenone
		- In contrast to spironolactone, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">eplerenone does not block androgen or progesterone receptors, which decreases certain side effects</span> (e.g., gynecomastia and decreased libido); <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">however, eplerenone is only half as potent</span> at blocking the mineralocorticoid receptor and is less effective at lowering blood pressure.
