# Epidemiology
- Most common malignancy of the adrenal medulla in infants
- Mean age at diagnosis: 1–2 years

---
# Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Amplification and overexpression of oncogene MYCN (N-myc)</span>

# Pathophysiology
- Homer Wright rosettes: Halo-like clusters of neuroblast cells surrounding a central pale area containing neuropil (associated with tumors of neuronal origin such as neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumors, and pineoblastoma)![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231006151208.png|Pasted image 20231006151208.png]]
- Bombesin and NSE positive
	- > A tumor marker for neuroblastoma, small cell carcinoma of the lung, [[../GI/Pancreatic cancer|pancreatic cancer]], and gastric cancer.

## [[../Respiratory/Paraneoplastic syndromes|Paraneoplastic syndromes]]
- Chronic diarrhea → electrolyte imbalances 
- Opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia: a paraneoplastic syndrome of unclear etiology characterized by rapid and multi-directional eye movements, rhythmic jerks of the limbs, and ataxia (dancing eyes dancing feet syndrome) 
- Possibly hypertension, tachycardia, palpitations, sweating, flushing  (hypertension is more commonly seen in pheochromocytoma)

# Diagnostics
## Laboratory tests
- Urine
	- ↑ Catecholamine metabolites homovanillic acid (HVA) and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) in 24-hour urine
- Blood
	- ↑ Catecholamine metabolites (HVA/VMA)
	- ↑ Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, neuron-specific enolase (NSE)
