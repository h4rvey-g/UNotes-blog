## Overview
- Carcinoid tumors are <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">neuroendocrine tumors</span> that arise from amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation cells (APUD cells).
	- A group of endocrine cells that secrete peptide hormones (e.g., secretin, cholecystokinin)
	- These cells take up amine precursors (e.g., 5-hydroxytryptophan) and decarboxylate them to form amines.
- Neuroendocrine cells (including β cells in the pancreas or enterochromaffin cells in the GI tract) belong to the APUD series and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">share a common biologic function</span> despite their different embryologic origins, anatomic sites, and secretory products (e.g., serotonin, histamine).
## Tumor location
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">GI tract (55% of cases):</span>
	- Small intestine (esp. the ileum): 45%
	- Rectum: 20%
	- Appendix: 17%
- Pancreas (15% of cases)
	- Insulinoma
	- Glucagonoma
- Bronchopulmonary system (10% of cases)
	- Carcinoid lung tumor
	- Small cell carcinoma
- Thyroid: medullary carcinoma
- Adrenal glands: pheochromocytoma
## Secretory products
- Carcinoid tumors can synthesize different hormones (most commonly [[../Neurology/Neurotransmitters|serotonin]]).
- [[../Neurology/Neurotransmitters|Serotonin]] is degraded via the following mechanisms:
	- First-pass metabolism in the liver
	- Monoamine oxidases in the lung
- Serotonin can reach systemic circulation under the following conditions:
	- Intestinal carcinoid tumors with liver metastases 
	- Extraintestinal carcinoid tumors 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Serotonin in systemic circulation</span> can lead to:
	- Carcinoid syndrome
	- Carcinoid heart disease
	- Pellagra due to increased serotonin metabolism

# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Carcinoid syndrome</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Diarrhea and abdominal cramps</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cutaneous flushing </span>
		- Caused by vasodilation of small arteries and arterioles
		- Possible triggers: alcohol consumption, food intake, stress
		- In severe cases, may be accompanied by tachycardia and fluctuating blood pressure
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dyspnea, wheezing ([[../Respiratory/Asthma|asthma]]-like attacks)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Palpitations</span>
	- Possible weight loss despite normal appetite
- Carcinoid heart disease
	- Liver metastases of the carcinoid tumor produce serotonin which travels to the right heart via the IVC.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Endocardial fibrosis that especially affects the right heart </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tricuspid insufficiency and/or pulmonary stenosis</span>
	- Symptoms of right-sided [[../Cardiology/Heart failure|heart failure]]
- Other symptoms: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">abdominal pain</span>

>[!tip] 
>In a patient presenting with secretory [[../GI/Diarrhea|diarrhea]], episodic flushing, wheezing, and cardiac valvular abnormalities, consider a carcinoid tumor.

# Diagnostics
- ↑ 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in 24-hour urine collection
	- A degradation product of serotonin metabolism. Elevated levels in 24-hour urine are seen in carcinoid tumor.
## Biopsy 
- Histology
	- Can show a variety of architectural patterns (e.g., islands, nests, trabeculae)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Prominent rosettes composed of numerous small monomorphic cells with salt-and-pepper chromatin </span>![[../../assets/img/L71504.jpg|L71504.jpg]]![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240429202129.png|Pasted image 20240429202129.png]]
- Immunohistochemistry: immunostaining with synaptophysin, chromogranin A, and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) to confirm neuroendocrine origin

# Treatment
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Somatostatin analogs (e.g., octreotide) to relieve symptoms</span>
	- ↓ 5-HIAA levels in the urine
	- High-dose treatment slows progression and increases survival time
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitors (e.g., telotristat)</span> as adjunctive therapy if diarrhea is not controlled with somatostatin analogs
	- rate-limiting step of serotonin synthesis
