# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sheehan syndrome: postpartum necrosis of the pituitary gland. Usually occurs following [[../Reproductive/Postpartum hemorrhage|postpartum hemorrhage]]</span>, but can also occur even without clinical evidence of hemorrhage.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">During [[../Reproductive/Pregnancy|pregnancy]], hypertrophy of prolactin-producing regions increases the size of the pituitary gland, making it very sensitive to ischemia.</span>
	- Blood loss during delivery/[[../Reproductive/Postpartum hemorrhage|postpartum hemorrhage]] → hypovolemia → vasospasm of hypophyseal vessels → ischemia of the pituitary gland → empty sella turcica on imaging

# Pathophysiology
- Hypopituitarism refers to deficiency of one or more anterior pituitary hormones
	- GH deficiency → growth retardation (during childhood), ↓ bone density, muscle atrophy, hypercholesterolemia
	- Prolactin deficiency → lactation failure following delivery 
	- FSH/LH deficiency → hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (secondary hypogonadism)
	- TSH deficiency → secondary [[../Biochemistry/Hypothyroidism|hypothyroidism]]
	- ACTH deficiency → secondary [[./Adrenal insufficiency|adrenal insufficiency]] 
- In addition to the aforementioned hormone deficiencies, patients with severe pituitary damage (panhypopituitarism) also present with deficiencies of posterior pituitary hormones:
	- ADH deficiency → central [[../Renal/Diabetes insipidus|diabetes insipidus]]
	- Oxytocin deficiency → no effect
