# Epidemiology
## Type 2 DM
- Age
	- Adult onset typically > 40 years
	- Mean age of onset is decreasing
- Race: highest prevalence in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Native Americans</span>, Hispanics, African Americans, and Asian non-Hispanic Americans

---
# Etiology
## Type 1 DM
- Autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β cells in genetically susceptible individuals
- HLA association: [[../Immunology/HLA system|HLA-DR3]] and [[../Immunology/HLA system|HLA-DR4]] positive patients are at increased risk of developing T1DM. 
- Associated with other autoimmune conditions
	- [[./Hashimoto thyroiditis|Hashimoto thyroiditis]]
	- Type A gastritis
	- [[../GI/Celiac disease|Celiac disease]]
	- Primary [[./Adrenal insufficiency|adrenal insufficiency]]

# Pathophysiology
## Normal insulin physiology
- Secretion: Insulin is synthesized in the β cells of the islets of Langerhans. The <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">cleavage of proinsulin (precursor molecule of insulin)</span> produces C-peptide (connecting peptide) and insulin, which consists of two peptide chains (A and B chains).
- Action
	- Carbohydrate metabolism
	- Protein metabolism: insulin inhibits proteolysis, stimulates protein synthesis, and stimulates cellular uptake of amino acids
	- Lipid metabolism: maintains a fat depot and has an antiketogenic effect 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Electrolyte regulation: stimulates intracellular potassium accumulation </span>
		- Directly stimulates Na<sup>+</sup>sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase and promotes intracellular alkalosis, reduces phosphate levels (glucose binds to phosphate in the cell), and stimulates magnesium uptake into cells
## Type 2 diabetes
- Mechanisms
	- Peripheral insulin resistance
		- Numerous genetic and environmental factors
			- Central obesity → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased plasma levels of free fatty acids → impaired insulin-dependent glucose uptake</span> into hepatocytes, myocytes, and adipocytes 
			- Increased serine kinase activity in fat and skeletal muscle cells → phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 → decreased affinity of IRS-1 for PI3K → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decreased expression of GLUT4 channels → decreased cellular glucose uptake</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pancreatic β cell dysfunction: accumulation of pro-amylin (islet amyloid polypeptide) in the pancreas  → decreased endogenous insulin production</span>
- Progression
	- Initially, insulin resistance is compensated by increased insulin and amylin secretion. 
	- Over the course of the disease, insulin resistance progresses, while insulin secretion capacity declines.
	- After a period of impaired glucose tolerance with isolated postprandial hyperglycemia, diabetes manifests with [[../Biochemistry/Metabolic fuel use|fasting]] hyperglycemia.

# Clinical features
## Onset
### Type 1 DM
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Often sudden</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[./Hyperglycemic crises|Diabetic ketoacidosis]] ([[./Hyperglycemic crises|DKA]])</span> is the first manifestation in approx. one-third of cases.
### Type 2 DM
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Typically gradual</span>
- The majority of patients are asymptomatic. 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Some patients may present with a hyperglycemic crisis.</span>
	- Elderly patients especially may present in a [[./Hyperglycemic crises|hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state]].
	- Occasionally, patients with T2DM present with [[./Hyperglycemic crises|DKA]] , which mostly affects black and Hispanic individuals.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Symptoms of complications may be the first clinical sign of disease.</span>
## Common clinical features
- Classic symptoms of hyperglycemia
	- Polyuria, which can lead to secondary enuresis and nocturia in children 
	- Polydipsia 
	- Polyphagia
- Nonspecific symptoms
	- Unexplained weight loss

# Complications
## Microvascular disease
- Onset: typically arises 5–10 years after onset of disease
- Pathophysiology: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">chronic hyperglycemia → nonenzymatic glycation of proteins and lipids → thickening of the basal membrane with progressive function impairment and tissue damage</span>
- Manifestations
	- [[../Renal/Diabetic kidney disease|Diabetic nephropathy]]
	- Diabetic retinopathy, [[../Neurology/Glaucoma|glaucoma]]

		- Assay interference: heavy alcohol use
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Factors resulting in a falsely low HbA1c</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Decreased RBC lifespan</span>: e.g., due to acute blood loss, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell trait/disease, [[../Blood/Thalassemia|thalassemia]]</span>, G6PD-deficiency, [[../GI/Cirrhosis|cirrhosis]], hemolytic anemia, [[../Blood/Splenomegaly|splenomegaly]], antiretroviral drugs
		- Increased erythropoiesis: e.g., due to EPO therapy, reticulocytosis, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">pregnancy</span> (second and third trimesters), iron supplementation
## Additional studies

	- ↑ C-peptide levels may indicate insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia → T2DM
	- ↓ C-peptide levels indicate an absolute insulin deficiency → T1DM

>[!tip] 
>Glargine is a long-acting insulin analogue that forms insoluble complexes.  This leads to the formation of microprecipitates at the injection site that then slowly dissolve and are released into the circulation throughout the day.
