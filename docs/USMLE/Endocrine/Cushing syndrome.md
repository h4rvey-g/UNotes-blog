- High-dose dexamethasone suppression test
	- Used to differ ectopic ACTH secretion vs Cushing disease
	- This test is similar to the low-dose dexamethasone suppression test but uses 8 mg of dexamethasone. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most pituitary adenomas retain partial sensitivity to feedback inhibition in response to high doses of glucocorticoids, while ectopic tumors are resistant even to high doses.</span>

# Treatment
## Bilateral adrenalectomy
- Indications
	- Primary hypercortisolism caused by bilateral adrenal disease (recommended curative treatment)
	- Emergency treatment in severe ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism that cannot be controlled pharmacologically
	- Symptomatic treatment for metastatic or occult ectopic tumors
- Complication: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Nelson syndrome (post adrenalectomy syndrome)</span>
	- Etiology: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">bilateral adrenalectomy in patients with a previously undetected [[./Pituitary adenoma|pituitary adenoma]] </span>
	- Pathophysiology: bilateral adrenalectomy → no endogenous cortisol production → no negative feedback from cortisol on the [[../Neurology/Hypothalamus|hypothalamus]] → ↑ CRH production → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">uncontrolled enlargement of preexisting but undetected ACTH-secreting [[./Pituitary adenoma|pituitary adenoma]] → ↑ secretion of ACTH and MSH</span> → manifestation of symptoms due to [[./Pituitary adenoma|pituitary adenoma]] and ↑ MSH
	- Clinical features: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">headache, bitemporal hemianopia (mass effect), cutaneous hyperpigmentation</span>
	- Diagnostics
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">High levels of β-MSH and ACTH</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[./Pituitary adenoma|Pituitary adenoma]] on MRI confirms the diagnosis.</span>
	- Treatment: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">surgery (e.g., transsphenoidal resection) and/or pituitary radiation therapy (e.g., if the tumor cannot be fully resected)</span>
