# Epidemiology
- Hashimoto disease is <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">the most common form of thyroiditis and the most frequent cause of [[../Biochemistry/Hypothyroidism|hypothyroidism]] in the US.</span>
- Iodine deficiency is the most common cause of [[../Biochemistry/Hypothyroidism|hypothyroidism]] worldwide.
- Sex: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">♀ > ♂ (7:1)</span>
- Age of onset: occurs in all age groups; <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">most prevalent in women aged 30–50 years</span>

# Etiology


---
# Pathophysiology
- Associations with [[../Immunology/HLA system|HLA-DR3]], and DR5 have been proposed.
- Cellular (especially T cells) and humoral immune responses are activated  → active <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">B lymphocytes produce thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAbs) and thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAbs) → destruction of thyroid tissue</span>

# Clinical features
- Early-stage
	- Primarily asymptomatic
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[./Goiter|Goiter]]: nontender or painless</span>, rubbery thyroid with moderate and symmetrical enlargement
	- Hashitoxicosis may occur: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">transient thyrotoxicosis</span> due to follicular rupture of hormone-containing thyroid tissue that manifests with signs of [[./Hyperthyroidism|hyperthyroidism]] (e.g., irritability, heat intolerance, [[../GI/Diarrhea|diarrhea]])
- Late-stage
	- Thyroid may be normal-sized or small if extensive fibrosis has occurred.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Signs of [[../Biochemistry/Hypothyroidism|hypothyroidism]]</span> (e.g., cold intolerance, constipation, fatigue)

# Diagnostics
- Thyroid function tests (TFTs)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Early-stage: Transient hashitoxicosis</span> may appear (↓ TSH, ↑ FT3, and ↑ FT4).
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Progression: subclinical [[../Biochemistry/Hypothyroidism|hypothyroidism]]</span> (mildly ↑ TSH; normal FT3 and FT4) 
	- Late-stage: overt [[../Biochemistry/Hypothyroidism|hypothyroidism]] (↑ TSH; ↓ FT4 and ↓ FT3)
- Thyroid antibodies
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anti-TPOAbs</span> (formerly anti-microsomal antibodies): positive in up to 95% of patients
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anti-TgAbs</span>: positive in 60–80% of patients
- Fine-needle aspiration
	- Indications: patients with focal nodules to exclude malignancy (see “Workup of thyroid nodules”)
	- Findings: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">diffuse lymphocytic infiltration (cytotoxic T lymphocytes) with germinal centers, oncocytic-metaplastic cells (Hurthle cells)</span>, and fibrotic tissue![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231202105205.png|Pasted image 20231202105205.png]]![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231202105218.png|Pasted image 20231202105218.png]]The thyroid tissue in the lower half of the image is inflamed, as evidenced by the lymphocytic infiltrate (numerous purple dots) and dilated, congested blood vessels (examples indicated by arrows). Prominent lymphoid follicles with a germinal center (example indicated by orange overlay) surrounded by a hypercellular parafollicular region (example indicated by green overlay) are visible in the inflamed region. Normal thyroid follicles (example indicated by blue overlay) are visible in the top half of the image but are absent in the inflamed region.
