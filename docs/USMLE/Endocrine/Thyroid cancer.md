# Etiology
- Genetic factors
	- Medullary carcinoma: associated with MEN2 (RET gene mutations) or familial medullary carcinoma
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Papillary carcinoma: associated with RET/PTC rearrangements and BRAF mutations</span>
	- Follicular carcinoma: associated with PAX8-PPAR-γ rearrangement and RAS mutation
	- Undifferentiated/anaplastic carcinoma: associated with TP53 mutation
- Ionizing radiation (particularly during childhood): mostly associated with papillary carcinoma
# Overview
## Papillary thyroid carcinoma 
- Tissue of origin: Thyrocytes
- Well differentiated
- Characteristics
	- Most common type of thyroid cancer
	- Palpable lymph nodes due to metastatic spread (often detected before primary tumor)
	- May be multifocal
	- Very good prognosis
 - Pathology
	 - Psam<font color="#ffc000">moma</font> bodies![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231221165709.png|Pasted image 20231221165709.png]]
		- Morphology: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">concentric lamellar calcifications</span>
		- Occurrence: seen in diseases associated with calcific degeneration
			- Papillary thyroid carcinomas (evidence of psammoma bodies in thyroid tissue should always raise suspicion of malignancy)
			- Serous papillary cystadenocarcinoma of ovary and endometrium
			- Meningiomas
			- Mesotheliomas

		- Morphology: empty-appearing large oval nuclei with central clearing![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231221171132.png|Pasted image 20231221171132.png]]
		- Occurrence
			- Papillary thyroid carcinomas
			- Autoimmune thyroiditis (e.g., Hashimoto disease, Grave disease)

## Medullary carcinoma
- Tissue of origin: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Parafollicular cells (C cells)</span>
	- The parafollicular cells are <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">located in the connective tissue between the thyroid follicles, which can be considered a "medullary" (central) part of the thyroid gland</span>, although not in the same sense as the medulla in other organs like the adrenal glands.
- Poorly differentiated
- Characteristics
	- Sometimes a genetic predisposition → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[./Multiple endocrine neoplasias|multiple endocrine neoplasia]] type 2 (MEN2)</span> (25% of medullary carcinomas)
	- Sporadic (75% of medullary carcinomas)
	- Produces [[./Calcitonin|calcitonin]]![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240317093756.png|Pasted image 20240317093756.png]]
- Pathology![[../../assets/img/highresdefault_L1488.jpg|highresdefault_L1488.jpg]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ovoid cells of C cell origin and therefore without follicle development</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Amyloid in the stroma (stains with Congo red)</span>
		- These amyloid deposits are derived from calcitonin secreted by the neoplastic C cells
