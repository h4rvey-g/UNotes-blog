- Definition: malignant tumor that develops from mesothelial cells
- Etiology
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Secondary to asbestos exposure </span>
	- Alcohol, smoking, and diet do not increase the incidence of mesothelioma.
- Clinical findings
	- Dyspnea and nonpleuritic chest pain (most common)
	- Fever, sweats, weight loss, fatigue
	- Features of [[./docs/USMLE/Blood/Pleural effusion|pleural effusion]]: dull percussion; absent or reduced breath sounds on affected side
- Diagnosis 
	- Pleurocentesis : <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">bloody (exudative) [[./docs/USMLE/Blood/Pleural effusion|pleural effusion]]</span>
	- Imaging (chest x-ray and CT) 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Multiple nodular pleural lesions (pleural thickening)</span>![[./docs/assets/img/Pasted image 20240318202845.png|Pasted image 20240318202845.png]]
	- Laparoscopy, thoracoscopy, and pleuroscopy with stained biopsy:  reveal mesothelioma cells and psammoma bodies
		- It is important to differentiate mesothelioma from adenocarcinoma. 
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Immunohistochemistry: Mesothelioma often stains positive for mesothelin, serum mesothelin-related protein (SMRP), calretinin, cytokeratin 5/6 (negative in most adenocarcinomas), and vimentin. </span>
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Electron microscopy shows tumor cells with long and slender microvilli (in contrast to the short and stubby microvilli found in adenocarcinomas), tonofilaments, and desmosomes.</span>
